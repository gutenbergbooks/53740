<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE">PREFACE</a></h2>


<p>This book is written for the many observers, who use telescopes
for study or pleasure and desire more information about
their construction and properties. Not being a “handbook” in
two or more thick quartos, it attempts neither exhaustive technicalities
nor popular descriptions of great observatories and their
work. It deals primarily with principles and their application to
such instruments as are likely to come into the possession, or
within reach, of students and others for whom the Heavens have
a compelling call.</p>

<p>Much has been written of telescopes, first and last, but it is for
the most part scattered through papers in three or four languages,
and quite inaccessible to the ordinary reader. For his benefit the
references are, so far as is practicable, to English sources, and
dimensions are given, regretfully, in English units. Certain
branches of the subject are not here discussed for lack of space
or because there is recent literature at hand to which reference
can be made. Such topics are telescopes notable chiefly for their
dimensions, and photographic apparatus on which special treatises
are available.</p>

<p>Celestial photography is a branch of astronomy which stands
on its own feet, and although many telescopes are successfully
used for photography through the help of color screens, the
photographic telescope proper and its use belongs to a field
somewhat apart, requiring a technique quite its own.</p>

<p>It is many years, however, since any book has dealt with the
telescope itself, apart from the often repeated accounts of the
marvels it discloses. The present volume contains neither pictures
of nebulæ nor speculations as to the habitibility of the
planets; it merely attempts to bring the facts regarding the
astronomer’s chief instrument of research somewhere within
grasp and up to the present time.</p>

<p>The author cordially acknowledges his obligations to the
important astronomical journals, particularly the Astro-physical
Journal, and Popular Astronomy in this country; The Observatory,
and the publications of the Royal Astronomical Society<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[Pg iv]</a></span>
in England; the Bulletin de la Société Astronomique de France;
and the Astronomische Nachrichten; which, with a few other journals
and the official reports of observatories form the body of
astronomical knowledge. He also acknowledges the kindness of
the various publishers who have extended the courtesy of illustrations,
especially Macmillan &amp; Co. and the Clarendon Press,
and above all renders thanks to the many friends who have
cordially lent a helping hand—the Director and staff of the
Harvard Observatory, Dr. George E. Hale, C. A. R. Lundin,
manager of the Alvan Clark Corporation, J. B. McDowell, successor
of the Brashear Company, J. E. Bennett, the American
representative of Carl Zeiss, Jena, and not a few others.</p>

<small>THE EVOLUTION OF THE TELESCOPE</small></h2>


<p>In the credulous twaddle of an essay on the Lost Arts one may
generally find the telescope ascribed to far antiquity. In place
of evidence there is vague allusion of classical times or wild
flights of fancy like one which argued from the Scriptural statement
that Satan took up Christ into a high mountain and
showed him all the kingdoms of the earth, that the Devil had a
telescope—bad optics and worse theology.</p>

<p>In point of fact there is not any indication that either in classical
times, or in the black thousand years of hopeless ignorance
that followed the fall of Roman civilization, was there any
knowledge of optical instruments worth mentioning.</p>

<p>The peoples that tended their flocks by night in the East alone
kept alive the knowledge of astronomy, and very gradually, with
the revival of learning, came the spirit of experiment that led
to the invention of aids to man’s natural powers.</p>

<p>The lineage of the telescope runs unmistakably back to
spectacles, and these have an honorable history extending over
more than six centuries to the early and fruitful days of the
Renaissance.</p>

<p>That their origin was in Italy near the end of the thirteenth
century admits of little doubt. A Florentine manuscript letter
of 1289 refers to “Those glasses they call spectacles, lately
invented, to the great advantage of poor old men when their
sight grows weak,” and in 1305 Giordano da Rivalto refers to
them as dating back about twenty years.</p>

<p>Finally, in the church of Santa Maria Maggiore in Florence lay
buried Salvino d’Amarto degli Armati, (obiit 1317) under an
epitaph, now disappeared, ascribing to him the invention of
spectacles. W. B. Carpenter, F. R. S., states that the inventor
tried to keep the valuable secret to himself, but it was discovered
and published before his death. At all events the discovery
moved swiftly. By the early fourteenth century it had spread to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
the Low Countries where it was destined to lead to great results,
and presently was common knowledge over all civilized Europe.</p>

<p>It was three hundred years, however, between spectacles
and the combination of spectacle lenses into a telescope, a lapse
of time which to some investigators has seemed altogether
mysterious. The ophthalmological facts lead to a simple explanation.
The first spectacles were for the relief of presbyopia, the
common and lamentable affection of advancing years, and for
this purpose convex lenses of very moderate power sufficed, nor
was material variation in power necessary. Glasses having a
uniform focus of a foot and a half or thereabouts would serve
every practical purpose, but would be no material for telescopes.</p>

<p>Myopia was little known, its acquired form being rare in a
period of general illiteracy, and glasses for its correction, especially
as regards its higher degrees, probably came slowly and
were in very small demand, so that the chance of an optical
craftsman having in hand the ordinary convex lenses and those
of strong negative curvature was altogether remote. Indeed it
was only in 1575 that Maurolycus published a clear description
of myopia and hypermetropia with the appropriate treatment by
the use of concave and convex lenses. Until both of these, in
quite various powers, were available, there was small chance of
hitting upon an instrument that required their use in a highly
special combination.</p>

<p>At all events there is no definite trace of the discovery of
telescopic vision until 1608 and the inventor of record is
unquestionably one Jan Lippershey, a spectacle maker of Middelburg
in Zeeland, a native of Wesel. On Oct. 2, 1608 the States-General
took under consideration a petition which had been
presented by Lippershey for a 30-year patent to the exclusive
right of manufacture of an instrument for seeing at a distance, or
for a suitable pension, under the condition that he should make
the instrument only for his country’s service.</p>

<p>The States General pricked up its ears and promptly appointed
on Oct. 4 a committee to test the new instrument from a tower of
Prince Maurice’s palace, allotting 900 florins for the purchase of
the invention should it prove good. On the 6th the committee
reported favorably and the Assembly agreed to give Lippershey
900 florins for his instrument, but desired that it be arranged for
use with both eyes.</p>

<p>Lippershey therefore pushed forward to the binocular form and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
two months later, Dec. 9, he announced his success. On the
15th the new instrument was examined and pronounced good,
and the Assembly ordered two more binoculars, of rock crystal,
at the same price. They denied a patent on the ground that the
invention was known to others, but paid Lippershey liberally as a
sort of retainer to secure his exclusive services to the State. In
fact even the French Ambassador, wishing to obtain an instrument
from him for his King, had to secure the necessary authorization
from the States-General.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<div class="caption"><i>Bull. de la Soc. Astron. de France.</i><br />
<span class="smcap">Fig. 1.</span>—Jan Lippershey, Inventor of the Telescope.</div>
</div>

<p>It is here pertinent to enquire what manner of optic tube
Lippershey showed to back up his petition, and how it had come
to public knowledge. As nearly as we may know these first telescopes
were about a foot and a half long, as noted by Huygens, and
probably an inch and a half or less in aperture, being constructed
of an ordinary convex lens such as was used in spectacles for the
aged, and of a concave glass suitable for a bad case of short
sightedness, the only kind in that day likely to receive attention.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span></p>

<p>It probably magnified no more than three or four diameters
and was most likely in a substantial tube of firmly rolled, glued,
and varnished paper, originally without provision for focussing,
since with an eye lens of rather low power the need of adjustment
would not be acute.</p>

<p>As to the invention being generally known, the only definite
attempt to dispute priority was made by James Metius of
Alkmaar, who, learning of Lippershey’s petition, on Oct. 17, 1608,
filed a similar one, alleging that through study and labor extending
over a couple of years he, having accidentally hit upon the
idea, had so far carried it out that his instrument made distant
objects as distinct as the one lately offered to the States by a
citizen and spectacle maker of Middelburg.</p>

<p>He apparently did not submit an instrument, was politely
told to perfect his invention before his petition was further considered,
and thereafter disappears from the scene, whatever his
merits. If he had actually noted telescopic vision he had neither
appreciated its enormous importance nor laid the facts before
others who might have done so.</p>

<p>The only other contemporary for whom claims have been made
is Zacharius Jansen, also a spectacle maker of Middelburg, to
whom Pierre Borel, on entirely second hand information, ascribed
the discovery of the telescope. But Borel wrote nearly fifty
years later, after all the principals were dead, and the evidence
he collected from the precarious memories of venerable witnesses
is very conflicting and points to about 1610 as the date when
Jansen was making telescopes—like many other spectacle
makers.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>Borel also gave credence to a tale that Metius, seeking
Jansen, strayed into Lippershey’s shop and by his inquiries gave
the shrewd proprietor his first hint of the telescope, but set the
date at 1610. A variation of this tale of the mysterious stranger,
due to Hieronymus Sirturus, contains the interesting intimation
that he may have been of supernatural origin—not further specified.
There are also the reports, common among the ignorant
or envious, that Lippershey’s discovery was accidental, even
perhaps made by his children or apprentice.</p>

<p>Just how it actually was made we do not know, but there
is no reason to suppose that it was not in the commonplace way<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
of experimenting with and testing lenses that he had produced,
perhaps those made to meet a vicious case of myopia in one of
his patrons.</p>

<p>When the discovery was made is somewhat clearer. Plainly
it antedated Oct. 2, and in Lippershey’s petition is a definite
statement that an instrument had already been tested by some,
at least, of the members of the States-General. A somewhat
vague and gossipy note in the <i>Mercure Française</i> intimates that
one was presented to Prince Maurice “about September of the
past year” (1608) and that it was shown to the Council of State
and to others.</p>

<p>Allowing a reasonable time between Lippershey’s discovery
and the actual production of an example suitable for exhibition
to the authorities, it seems likely that the invention dates back
certainly into the summer of 1608, perhaps even earlier.</p>

<p>At all events there is every indication that the news of it
spread like wild-fire. Unless Lippershey were unusually careful
in keeping his secret, and there are traditions that he was not,
the sensational discovery would have been quickly known in the
little town and every spectacle maker whose ears it reached would
have been busy with it.</p>

<p>If the dates given by Simon Marius in his <i>Mundus Jovialis</i>
be correct, a Belgian with an air of mystery and a glass of which
one of the lenses was cracked, turned up at the Frankfort fair
in the autumn of 1608 and at last allowed Fuchs, a nobleman of
Bimbach, to look through the instrument. Fuchs noted that it
magnified “several” times, but fell out with the Belgian over the
price, and returning, took up the matter with Marius, fathomed
the construction, tried it with glasses from spectacles, attempted
to get a convex lens of longer focus from a Nuremburg maker,
who had no suitable tools, and the following summer got a fairly
good glass from Belgium where such were already becoming
common.</p>

<p>With this Marius eventually picked up three satellites of
Jupiter—the fourth awaited the arrival of a superior telescope
from Venice. Early in 1609 telescopes “about a foot long”
were certainly for sale in Paris, a Frenchman had offered one in
Milan by May of that year, a couple of months later one was in
use by Harriot in England, an example had reached Cardinal
Borghese, and specimens are said to have reached Padua. Fig. 2
from the “<i>Mundus Jovialis</i>,” shows Marius with his “Perspicil<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>ium,”
the first published picture of the new instrument. Early
in 1610 telescopes were being made in England, but if the few
reports of performance, even at this date, are trustworthy, the
“Dutch trunk” of that period was of very indifferent quality and
power, far from being an astronomical instrument.</p>

<span class="smcap">Fig. 2.</span>—Simon Marius and his Telescope.</div>
</div>

<p>One cannot lay aside this preliminary phase of the evolution
of the telescope without reference to the alleged descriptions of
telescopic apparatus by Roger Bacon, (c. 1270), Giambattista
della Porta (1558), and Leonard Digges (1571), details of which
may be found in Grant’s <i>History of Physical Astronomy</i> and many
other works.</p>

<p>Of these the first on careful reading conveys strongly the conviction
that the author had a pretty clear idea of refraction from
the standpoint of visual angle, yet without giving any evidence
of practical acquaintance with actual apparatus for doing the
things which he suggests.</p>

<p>Given a suitable supply of lenses, it is reasonably certain that
Bacon was clever enough to have devised both telescope and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
microscope, but there is no evidence that he did so, although his
manifold activities kept him constantly in public view. It does
not seem unlikely, however, that his suggestions in manuscripts,
quite available at the time, may have led to the contemporaneous
invention of spectacles.</p>

<p>Porta’s comments sound like an echo of Bacon’s, plus a rather
muddled attempt to imagine the corresponding apparatus.
Kepler, certainly competent and familiar with the principles
of the telescope, found his description entirely unintelligible.
Porta, however, was one of the earliest workers on the <i>camera
obscura</i> and upon this some of his cryptic statements may have
borne.</p>

<p>Somewhat similar is the situation respecting Digges. His son
makes reference to a Ms. of Roger Bacon as the source of the
marvels he describes. The whole account, however, strongly
suggests experiments with the <i>camera obscura</i> rather than with the
telescope.</p>

<p>The most that can be said with reference to any of the three
is that, if he by any chance fell upon the combination of lenses
that gave telescopic vision, he failed to set down the facts in any
form that could be or was of use to others. There is no reason
to believe that the Dutch discovery, important as it was, had
gone beyond the empirical observation that a common convex
spectacle lens and a concave one of relatively large curvature
could be placed in a tube, convex ahead, at such a distance apart
as to give a clear enlarged image of distant objects.</p>

<p>It remained for Galileo (1564-1647) to grasp the general
principles involved and to apply them to a real instrument of
research. It was in May 1609 that, on a visit to Venice, he heard
reports that a Belgian had devised an instrument which made
distant objects seem near, and this being quickly confirmed by a
letter from Paris he awakened to the importance of the issue and,
returning to Padua, is said to have solved the problem the very
night of his arrival.</p>

<p>Next day he procured a plano-convex and a plano-concave
lens, fitted them to a lead tube and found that the combination
magnified three diameters, an observation which indicates about
what it was possible to obtain from the stock of the contemporary
spectacle maker.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> The relation between the power and the foci<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
of the lenses he evidently quickly fathomed for his next recorded
trial reached about eight diameters.</p>

<p>With this instrument he proceeded to Venice and during a
month’s stay, August, 1609, exhibited it to the senators of the
republic and throngs of notables, finally disclosing the secret of
its construction and presenting the tube itself to the Doge
sitting in full council. This particular telescope was about
twenty inches long and one and five eighths inches in aperture,
showing plainly that Galileo had by this time found, or more
likely made, an eye lens of short focus, about three inches, quite
probably using a well polished convex lens of the ordinary sort
as objective.</p>

</div>

<p>Laden with honors he returned to Padua and settled down to
the hard work of development, grinding many lenses with his
own hands and finally producing the instrument magnifying
some 32 times, with which he began the notable succession of
discoveries that laid the foundation of observational astronomy.
This with another of similar dimensions is still preserved at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
Galileo Museum in Florence, and is shown in the Frontispiece.
The larger instrument is forty-nine inches long and an inch and
three quarters aperture, the smaller about thirty-seven inches long
and of an inch and five-eighths aperture. The tubes are of
paper, the glasses still remain, and these are in fact the first astronomical
telescopes.</p>

<p>Galileo made in Padua, and after his return to Florence in the
autumn of 1610, many telescopes which found their way over
Europe, but quite certainly none of power equalling or exceeding
these.</p>

<p>In this connection John Greaves, later Savilian Professor of Astronomy
at Oxford, writing from Sienna in 1639, says: “Galileus
never made but two good glasses, and those were of old Venice
glass.” In these best telescopes, however, the great Florentine
had clearly accomplished a most workmanlike feat. He had
brought the focus of his eye lens down to that usual in modern
opera glasses, and has pushed his power about to the limit for
simple lenses thus combined.</p>

<p>The lack of clear and homogeneous glass, the great difficulty
of forming true tools, want of suitable commercial abrasives,
impossibility of buying sheet metals or tubing (except lead),
and default of now familiar methods of centering and testing
lenses, made the production of respectably good instruments a
task the difficulty of which it is hard now to appreciate.</p>

<p>The services of Galileo to the art were of such profound importance,
that his form of instrument may well bear his name, even
though his eyes were not the first that had looked through it.
Such, too, was the judgment of his contemporaries, and it was
by the act of his colleagues in the renowned Acaddemia dei
Lincei, through the learned Damiscianus, that the name “Telescope”
was devised and has been handed down to us.</p>

<p>A serious fault of the Galilean telescope was its very small
field of view when of any considerable power. Galileo’s largest
instrument had a field of but 7′15″, less than one quarter the
moon’s diameter. The general reason is plain if one follows the
rays through the lenses as in Fig. 4 where <i>AB</i> is the distant object,
<i>o</i> the objective, <i>e</i> the eye lens, <i>ab</i> the real image in the absence of <i>e</i>,
and <i>a′b′</i> the virtual magnified image due to <i>e</i>.</p>

<p>It will be at once seen that the axes of the pencils of rays from
all parts of the object, as shown by the heavy lines, act as if they
diverged from the optical center of the objective, but diverging<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
still more by refraction through the concave eye lens <i>e</i>, fall mostly
outside the pupil of the observer’s eye. In fact the field is
approximately measured by the angle subtended by the pupil
from the center of <i>o</i>.</p>

<p>To the credit of the Galilean form may be set down the convenient
erect image, a sharp, if small, field somewhat bettered
by a partial compensation of the aberrations of the objective by
the concave eye lens, and good illumination. For a distant
object the lenses were spaced at the difference of their focal
lengths, and the magnifying power was the ratio of these, <i>f<sub>o</sub>/f<sub>e</sub></i>.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_010a.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 4.</span>—Diagram of Galileo’s Telescope.</div>
</div>
<p>But the difficulty of obtaining high power with a fairly sizeable
field was ultimately fatal and the type now survives only in the
form of opera and field glasses, usually of 2 to 5 power, and in an
occasional negative eye lens for erecting the image in observatory
work. Practically all the modern instruments have achromatic
objectives and commonly achromatic oculars.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_010b.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 5.</span>—Diagram of Kepler’s Telescope.</div>
</div>

<p>The necessary step forward was made by Johann Kepler
(1571-1630), the immortal discoverer of the laws of planetary
motion. In his <i>Dioptrice</i> (1611) he set forth the astronomical
telescope, substantially, save for the changes brought by
achromatism, as it has been used ever since. His arrangement
was that of Fig. 5 in which the letters have the same significance
as in Fig. 4.</p>

<p>There are here three striking differences from the Galilean
form. There is a real image in the front focus of the eye lens <i>e</i>,
the rays passing it are refracted inwards instead of outwards,
to the great advantage of the field, and any object placed in the
image plane will be magnified together with the image. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
first two points Kepler fully realized, the third he probably did
not, though it is the basis of the micrometer. The lenses <i>o</i> and
<i>e</i> are obviously spaced at the sum of their focal lengths, and as
before the magnifying power is the ratio of these lengths, the visible
image being inverted.</p>

<p>Kepler, so far as known, did not actually use the new telescope,
that honor falling about half a dozen years later, to Christopher
Scheiner, a Jesuit professor of mathematics at Ingolstadt, best
known as a very early and most persistent, not to say verbose,
observer of sun spots. His <i>Rosa Ursina</i> (1630) indicates free
use of Kepler’s telescope for some years previously, in just what
size and power is uncertain.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> Fontana of Naples also appears
to have been early in the field.</p>

<p>But the new instrument despite its much larger field and far
greater possibilities of power, brought with it some very serious
problems. With increased power came greatly aggravated
trouble from spherical aberration and chromatic aberration as
well, and the additive aberrations of the eye lens made matters
still worse. The earlier Keplerian instruments were probably
rather bad if the drawings of Fontana from 1629 to 1636
fairly represent them.</p>

<p>If one may judge from the course of developments, the first
great impulse to improvement came with the publication of
Descartes’ (1596-1650) study of dioptrics in 1637. Therein
was set forth much of the theory of spherical aberration and
astronomers promptly followed the clues, practical and impractical,
thus disclosed.</p>

<p>Without going into the theory of aberrations the fact of importance
to the improvement of the early telescope is that the
longitudinal spherical aberration of any simple lens is directly proportional
to its thickness due to curvature. Hence, other things
being equal, the longer the focus for the same aperture the less the
spherical aberration both absolutely and relatively to the image.
Further, although Descartes knew nothing of chromatic aberration,
and the colored fringe about objects seen through the telescope
must then have seemed altogether mysterious, it, also, was
greatly relieved by lengthening the focus.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span></p>

<p>For the chromatic circle produced by a simple lens of given
diameter has a radial width substantially irrespective of the focal
length. But increasing the focal length increases in exact proportion
the size of the image, correspondingly decreasing the relative
effect of the chromatic error.</p>

<p>Descartes also suggested several designs of lenses which would
be altogether free of spherical aberration, formed with elliptical
or hyperbolic curvature, and for some time fruitless efforts were
made to realize this in practice. It was in fact to be near a
century before anyone successfully figured non-spherical surfaces.
It was spherical quite as much as chromatic aberration that
drove astronomers to long telescopes.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the astronomical telescope fell into better hands
than those of Scheiner. The first fully to grasp its possibilities
was William Gascoigne, a gallant young gentleman of Middleton,
Yorkshire, born about 1620 (some say as early as 1612) and who
died fighting on the King’s side at Marston Moor, July 2, 1644.
To him came as early as 1638 the inspiration of utilizing the real
focus of the objective for establishing a telescopic sight.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_012.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 6.</span>—Diagram of Terrestrial Ocular.</div>
</div>

<p>This shortly took the form of a genuine micrometer consisting
of a pair of parallel blades in the focus, moved in opposite directions
by a screw of duplex pitch, with a scale for whole revolutions,
and a head divided into 100 parts for partial revolutions. With
this he observed much from 1638 to 1643, measured the diameters
of sun, moon and planets with a good degree of precision, and
laid the foundations of modern micrometry. He was equipped
by 1639 with what was then called a large telescope.</p>

<p>His untimely death, leaving behind an unpublished treatise
on optics, was a grave loss to science, the more since the manuscript
could not be found, and, swept away by the storms of war,
his brilliant work dropped out of sight for above a score of years.</p>

<p>Meanwhile De Rheita (1597-1660), a Capuchin monk, and an
industrious and capable investigator, had been busy with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
telescope, and in 1645 published at Antwerp a somewhat bizarre
treatise, dedicated to Jesus Christ, and containing not a little
practical information. De Rheita had early constructed binoculars,
probably quite independently, had lately been diligently
experimenting with Descartes’ hyperbolic lens, it is needless to
say without much success, and was meditating work on a colossal
scale—a glass to magnify 4,000 times.</p>

<p>But his real contribution to optics was the terrestrial ocular.
This as he made it is shown in Fig. 6 where <i>a b</i> is the image
formed by the objective in front of the eye lens r, s and t two
equal lenses separated by their focal lengths and <i>a′ b′</i> the resultant
reinverted image. This form remained in common use until
improved by Dolland more than a century later.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_013.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 7.</span>—Johannes Hevelius.</div>
</div>

<p>A somewhat earlier form ascribed to Father Scheiner had
merged the two lenses forming the inverting system of Fig.
6, into a single lens used at its conjugate foci.</p>

<p>Closely following De Rheita came Johannes Hevelius (1611-1687)
of Danzig, one of the really important observers of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
seventeenth century. His great treatise <i>Selenographia</i> published
in 1647 gives us the first systematic study of the moon, and a brief
but illuminating account of the instruments of the time and
their practical construction.</p>

<p>At this time the Galilean and Keplerian forms of telescope were
in concurrent use and Hevelius gives directions for designing and
making both of them. Apparently the current instruments were
not generally above five or six feet long and from Hevelius’ data
would give not above 30 diameters in the Galilean form. There
is mention, however, of tubes up to 12 feet in length, and of the
advantage in clearness and power of the longer focus plano-convex
lens. Paper tubes, evidently common, are condemned,
also those of sheet iron on account of their weight, and wood was
to be preferred for the longer tubes.</p>

<p>Evidently Hevelius had at this time no notion of the effect of
the plano-convex form of lens as such in lessening aberration, but
he mentions a curious form of telescope, actually due to De Rheita,
in which the objective is double, apparently of two plano-convex
lenses, the weaker ahead, and used with a concave eye lens.
If properly proportioned such a doublet would have less than a
quarter the spherical aberration of the equivalent double convex
lens.</p>

<p>Hevelius also mentions the earlier form of re-inverting telescope
above referred to, and speaks rather highly of its performance.
To judge from his numerous drawings of the moon made in 1643
and 1644, his telescopes were much better than those of Scheiner
and Fontana, but still woefully lacking in sharp definition.</p>

<p>Nevertheless the copper plates of the <i>Selenographia</i>, representing
every phase of the moon, placed the lunar details with remarkable
accuracy and formed for more than a century the best lunar
atlas available. One acquires an abiding respect for the patience
and skill of these old astronomers in seeing how much they did
with means utterly inadequate.</p>

<p>One may get a fair idea of the size, appearance, and mounting
of telescopes in this early day from Fig. 8, which shows a somewhat
advanced construction credited by Hevelius to a suggestion in
Descartes’ <i>Dioptrica</i>. Appearances indicate that the tube was
somewhere about six feet long, approximately two inches in
aperture, and that it had a draw tube for focussing. The offset
head of the mount to allow observing near the zenith is worth
an extra glance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span></p>

<p>Incidentally Hevelius, with perhaps pardonable pride, also
explains the “Polemoscope,” a little invention of his own, made, he
tells us, in 1637. It is nothing else than the first periscope,
constructed as shown in Fig. 9, a tube <i>c</i> with two right angled
branches, a fairly long one <i>e</i> for the objective <i>f</i>, a 45° mirror at <i>g</i>,
another at <i>a</i>, and finally the concave ocular at <i>b</i>. It was of
modest size, of tubes 1⅔ inch in diameter, the longer tube being
22 inches and the upper branch 8 inches, a size well suited for
trench or parapet.</p>

<div class="figright">

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span></p>

<p>Even in these days of his youth Hevelius had learned much of
practical optics as then known, had devised and was using very
rational methods of observing sun-spots by projection in a darkened
room, and gives perhaps the first useful hints at testing
telescopes by such solar observations and on the planets. He was
later to do much in the development and mounting of long telescopes
and in observation, although, while progressive in other
respects, he very curiously never seemed to grasp the importance
of telescopic sights and consistently refused to use them.</p>

<p>Telescope construction was now to fall into more skillful hands.
Shortly after 1650 Christian Huygens (1629-1695), and his
accomplished brother Constantine awakened to a keen interest
in astronomy and devised new and excellent methods of forming
accurate tools and of grinding and polishing lenses.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_016.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 9.</span>—The first Periscope.</div>
</div>
<p>By 1655 they had completed an instrument of 12 feet focus with
which the study of Saturn was begun, Titan the chief satellite
discovered, and the ring recognized. Pushing further, they
constructed a telescope of 23 feet focal length and 2⅓ inches
aperture, with which four years later Christian Huygens finally
solved the mystery of Saturn’s ring.</p>

<p>Evidently this glass, which bore a power of 100, was of good
defining quality, as attested by a sketch of Mars late in 1695
showing plainly Syrtis Major, from observation of which Huygens
determined the rotation period to be about 24 hours.</p>

<p>The Huygens brothers were seemingly the first fully to grasp
the advantage of very long focus in cutting down the aberrations,
the aperture being kept moderate. Their usual proportions were
about as indicated above, the aperture being kept somewhere
nearly as the square root of the focus in case of the larger glasses.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span></p>

<p>In the next two decades the focal length of telescopes was
pushed by all hands to desperate extremes. The Huygens
brothers extended themselves to glasses up to 210 feet focus and
built many shorter ones, a famous example of which, of 6 inches
aperture and 123 feet focal length, presented to the Royal
Society, is still in its possession. Auzout produced even longer
telescopes, and Divini and Campani, in Rome, of whom the last
named made Cassini’s telescopes for the Observatory of Paris,
were not far behind. The English makers were similarly busy,
and Hevelius in Danzig was keeping up the record.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_017.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 10.</span>—Christian Huygens.</div>
</div>

<p>Clearly these enormously long telescopes could not well be
mounted in tubes and the users were driven to aerial mountings,
in which the objective was at the upper end of a spar or girder
and the eye piece at the lower. Figure 11 shows an actual construction
by Hevelius for an objective of 150 feet focal length.</p>

<p>In this case the main support was a T beam of wooden planks
well braced together. Additional stiffness was given by light
wooden diaphragms at short intervals with apertures of about
8 inches next to the objective, and gradually increasing downwards.
The whole was lined up by equalizing tackle in the vertical
plane, and spreaders with other tackle at the joints of the 40<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>foot
sections of the main beam. The mast which supported
the whole was nearly 90 feet high.</p>

<p>So unwieldly and inconvenient were these long affairs that,
quite apart from their usual optical imperfections, it is little
wonder that they led to no results commensurate with their size.
In fact nearly all the productive work was done with telescopes
from 20 to 35 feet long, with apertures roughly between 2 and
3 inches.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_018.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 11.</span>—Hevelius’ 150-foot Telescope.</div>
</div>

<p>Dominique Cassini to be sure, scrutinizing Saturn in 1684 with
objectives by Campani, of 100 and 136 feet focus picked up the
satellites Tethys and Dione, but he had previously found Iapetus
with a 17-foot glass, and Rhea with one of 34 feet. The longer
glasses above mentioned had aerial mounts but the smaller
ones were in tubes supported on a sort of ladder tripod. A 20-foot
objective, power 90, gave Cassini the division in Saturn’s ring.</p>

<p>A struggle was still being kept up for the non-spherical curves
urged by Descartes. It is quite evident that Huygens had a go<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
at them, and Hevelius thought at one time that he had mastered
the hyperbolic figure, but his published drawings give no indication
that he had reduced spherical aberration to any perceptible
degree. At this time the main thing was to get good glass and
give it true figure and polish, in which Huygens and Campani
excelled, as the work on Saturn witnesses.</p>

<p>These were the days of the dawn of popular astronomy and
many a gentleman was aroused to at least a casual interest in
observing the Heavens. Notes Pepys in his immortal <i>Diary</i>:
“I find Reeves there, it being a mighty fine bright night, and so
upon my leads, though very sleepy, till one in the morning, looking
on the moon and Jupiter, with this twelve foot glass, and
another of six foot, that he hath brought with him to-night,
and the sights mighty pleasant, and one of the glasses I will buy.”</p>

<p>Little poor Pepys probably saw, by reason of his severe
astigmatism, but astronomy was
in the air with the impulse that
comes to every science after a
period of brilliant discovery. Another
such stimulus came near the
end of the eighteenth century,
with the labors of Sir William
Herschel.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/i_019.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 12.</span>—Gregory’s Diagram of his Telescope.</div>
</div>

<p>Just at this juncture comes one
of the interesting episodes of telescopic
history, the ineffectual and
abandoned experiments on reflecting
instruments.</p>

<p>In 1663 James Gregory (1638-1675)
a famous Scottish mathematician,
published his <i>Optica
Promota</i>, in which he described
the rather elegant construction
which bears his name, a perforated parabolic mirror with an
elliptical mirror forward of the focus returning an image to the
ocular through the perforation. It was convenient in that it
gave an erect image, and it was sound theoretically, and, as the
future proved, practically, but the curves were quite too much
for the contemporary opticians. Figure 12 shows the diagrammatic
construction as published.</p>

<p>The next year Gregory started Reive, a London optician,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
doubtless the same mentioned by Pepys, on the construction of a
6 foot telescope. This rather ambitious effort failed of material
success through the inability of Reive to give the needed figures
to the mirrors,<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> and of it nothing further appears until the ingenious
Robert Hooke (1635-1703) executed in 1674 a Gregorian,
apparently without any notable results. There is a well
defined tradition that Gregory himself was using one in 1675, at
the time of his death, but the invention then dropped out of sight.</p>

<p>No greater influence on the art attended the next attempt at a
reflector, by Isaac Newton (1643-1727). This was an early outcome
of his notable discovery of the dispersion of light by prisms,
which led him to despair of improving refracting telescopes and
turned his mind to reflectors.</p>

<p>Unhappily in an experiment to determine whether refraction
and dispersion were proportional he committed the singular
blunder of raising the refractive index of a water-filled prism to
equality with glass by dissolving sugar of lead in it. Without
realizing the impropriety of thus varying two quite unknown
quantities at once in his crucial experiment, he promptly jumped
to the conclusion that refraction and dispersion varied in exact
proportion in all substances, so that if two prisms or lenses
dispersed light to the same extent they must also equally refract
it. It would be interesting to know just how the fact of his
bungling was passed along to posterity. As a naïve apologist
once remarked, it was not to be found in his “<i>Optics</i>.”
But Sir David Brewster and Sir John Herschel, both staunch
admirers of the great philosopher, state the fact very positively.
If one may hazard a guess it crept out at Cambridge and was
passed along, perhaps to Sir William Herschel, via the unpublished
history of research that is rich in picturesque details of the
mare’s nests of science. At all events a mistake with a great
name behind it carries far, and the result was to delay the
production of the achromatic telescope by some three quarters
of a century.</p>

<p>Turning from refractors he presented to the Royal Society
just after his election as Fellow in 1672, the little six-inch model of
his device which was received with acclamation and then lay on
the shelf without making the slightest impression on the art, for
full half a century.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span></p>

<p>Newton, by dropping the notion of direct view through the
tube, hit upon by far the simplest way of getting the image outside
it, by a plane mirror a little inside focus and inclined at 45°,
but injudiciously abandoned the parabolic mirror of his original
paper on dispersion. His invention therefore as actually
made public was of the combination with a spherical concave
mirror of a plane mirror of elliptical form at 45°, a construction
which in later papers he defended as fully adequate.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_021.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 13.</span>—Newton’s Model of his Reflector.</div>
</div>

<p>His error in judgment doubtless came from lack of practical
astronomical experience, for he assumed that the whole real
trouble with existing telescopes was chromatic aberration, which
in fact worried the observer little more than the faults due to
other causes, since the very low luminosity toward the ends<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
of the spectrum enormously lessens the indistinctness due to
dispersion.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact the long focus objective of small aperture
did very creditable work, and its errors would not compare
unfavorably with those of a spherical concave mirror of the wide
aperture planned by Newton. Had he actually made one of

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 14.</span>—De Bercé’s sketch of Cassegrain’s Telescope.</div>
</div>

<p>It is quite likely that appreciation of this, and the grave doubts
of both Newton and Huygens as to obtaining a proper parabolic
curve checked further developments. About the beginning of
the year 1672 M. Cassegrain communicated to M. de Bercé a
design for a reflecting telescope, which eventually found its way
into the <i>Philosophical Transactions</i> of May in that year, after
previous publication in the <i>Journal des Sçavans</i>. Figure 14 shows
de Bercé’s rough original sketch. It differed from Gregory’s
construction in that the latter’s elliptical concave mirror placed
outside the main focus, was replaced by a convex mirror placed
inside focus. The image was therefore inverted.</p>

<p>The inventor is referred to in histories of science as “Cassegrain,
a Frenchman.” He was in fact Sieur Guillaume Cassegrain,
sculptor in the service of Louis Quatorze, modeller and founder
of many statues. In 1666 he was paid 1200 livres for executing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
a bust of the King modelled by Bertin, and later made many
replicas from the antique for the decoration of His Majesty’s
gardens at Versailles. He disappeared from the royal records in
1684 and probably died within a year or two of that date.</p>

<p>At the period here concerned he apparently, like de Bercé, was
of Chartres. Familiar with working bronzes and with the art
of the founder, he was a very likely person to have executed
specula. Although there is no certainty that he actually made a
telescope, a contemporary reference in the <i>Journal des Sçavans</i>
speaks of his invention as a “petite lunette d’approche,” and one
does not usually suggest the dimensions of a thing non-existent.
How long he had been working upon it prior to the period about
the beginning of 1672 when he disclosed the device to de Bercé
is unknown.</p>

<p>Probably Newton’s invention was the earlier, but the two were
independent, and it was somewhat ungenerous of Newton to
criticise Cassegrain, as he did, for using spherical mirrors, on the
strength of de Bercé’s very superficial description, when he himself
considered the parabolic needless.</p>

<p>However, nothing further was done, and the devices of Gregory,
Newton and Cassegrain went together into the discard for some
fifty years.</p>

<p>These early experiments gave singularly little information
about material for mirrors and methods of working it, so little
that those who followed, even up to Lord Rosse, had to work
the problems out for themselves. We know from his original
paper that Newton used bell-metal, whitened by the addition of
arsenic, following the lore of the alchemists.</p>

<p>These speculative worthies used to alloy copper with arsenic,
thinking that by giving it a whitish cast they had reached a sort
of half way point on the road to silver. Very silly at first
thought, but before the days of chemical analysis, when the
essential properties of the metals were unknown, the way of the
scientific experimenter was hard.</p>

<p>What the “steely matter, imployed in London” of which
Newton speaks in an early paper was, we do not know—very
likely one of the hard alloys much richer in tin than is ordinary
bell-metal. Nor do we know to what variety of speculum metal
Huygens refers in his correspondence with Newton.</p>

<p>As to methods of working it Newton only disclosed his scheme
of pitch-polishing some thirty years after this period, while it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
a matter of previous record, that Huygens had been in the habit
of polishing his true tools on pitch from some date unknown.
Probably neither of them originated the practice. Opticians
are a peculiarly secretive folk and shop methods are likely to be
kept for a long time before they leak out or are rediscovered.</p>

<p>Modern speculum metal is substantially a definite compound
of four atoms copper and one tin (SnCu<sub>4</sub>), practically 68 per
cent copper and 32 per cent tin, and is now, as it was in all
previous modifications, a peculiarly mean material to cast and
work. Thus exit the reflector.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i_024.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 15.</span>—Diagram of Huygens’ Eyepiece.</div>
</div>

<p>The long telescope continued to grow longer with only slow
improvement in quality, but the next
decade was marked by the introduction
of Huygens’ eyepiece, an immense
improvement over the single
lens which had gone before, and with
slight modifications in use today.</p>

<p>This is shown in section in Fig. 15.
It consists of a field lens <i>A</i>, plano-convex,
and an eye lens <i>B</i> of one-third
the focal length, the two being placed
at the difference of their focal lengths
apart with (in later days) a stop half way between them. The
eye piece is pushed inside the main focus until the rays which fall
on the field lens focus through the eye lens.</p>

<p>The great gain from Huygens’ view-point was a very much
enlarged clear field—about a four-fold increase—and in fact the
combination is substantially achromatic, particularly important
now when high power oculars are needed.</p>

<p>Still larger progress was made in giving the objective a better
form with respect to spherical aberration, the “crossed” lens being
rather generally adopted. This form is double convex, and if of
ordinary glass, with the rear radius six times the front radius, and
gives even better results than a plano-convex in its best position-plane
side to the rear. Objectives were rated on focal length for
the green rays, that is, the bright central part of the spectrum, the
violet rays of course falling short and the red running beyond.</p>

<p>To give customary dimensions, a telescope of 3 inches aperture,
with magnifying power of 100, would be of about 30 feet focus
with the violet nearly 6 inches short and the red a similar amount
long. It is vast credit to the early observers that with such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
slender means they did so much. But in fact the long telescope
had reached a mechanical <i>impasse</i>, so that the last quarter of the
seventeenth century and the first quarter of the next were marked
chiefly by the development of astronomy of position with instruments
of modest dimensions.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 16.</span>—The First Reflector. John Hadley, 1722.</div>
</div>

<p>In due time the new order came and with astounding suddenness.
Just at the end of 1722 James Bradley (1692-1762)
measured the diameter of Venus with an objective of 212 ft.
3 in. focal length; about three months later John Hadley (1682-1744)
presented to the Royal Society the first reflecting telescope
worthy the name, and the old order practically ended.</p>

<p>John Hadley should in fact be regarded as the real inventor of
the reflector in quite the same sense that Mr. Edison has been
held, <i>de jure</i> and <i>de facto</i>, the inventor of the incandescent elec<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>tric
lamp. Actually Hadley’s case is the stronger of the two,
for the only things which could have been cited against him were
abandoned experiments fifty years old. Moreover he took successfully
the essential step at which Gregory and Newton had
stumbled or turned back—parabolizing his speculum.</p>

<p>The instrument he presented was of approximately 6 inches
aperture and 62⅝ inches focal length, which he had made
and tested some three years previously; on a substantial alt-azimuth
mount with slow motions. He used the Newtonian
oblique mirror and the instrument was provided with both
convex and concave eye lenses, with magnifications up to
about 230.</p>

<p>The whole arrangement is shown in Fig. 16 which is for the most
part self explanatory. It is worth noting that the speculum
is positioned in the wooden tube by pressing it forward against
three equidistant studs by three corresponding screws at the rear,
that a slider moved by a traversing screw in a wide groove
carries the small mirror and the ocular, that there is a convenient
door for access to the mirror, and also a suitable finder. The
motion in altitude is obtained by a key winding its cord against
gravity. That in azimuth is by a roller support along a horizontal
runway carried by an upright, and is obtained by the key
with a cord pull off in one direction, and in the other, by springs
within the main upright, turning a post of which the head carries
cheek pieces on which rest the trunnions of the tube.</p>

<p>A few months later this telescope was carefully tested, by
Bradley and the Rev. J. Pound, against the Huygens objective
of 123 feet focus possessed by the Royal Society, and with
altogether satisfactory results. Hadley’s reflector would show
everything which could be seen by the long instrument, bearing as
much power and with equal definition, though somewhat lessened
light. In particular they saw all five satellites of Saturn, Cassini’s
division, which the inventor himself had seen the previous
year even in the northern edge of the ring beyond the planet, and
the shadow of the ring upon the ball.</p>

<p>The casting of the large speculum was far from perfect, with
many spots that failed to take polish, but the figure must have
been rather good. A spherical mirror of these dimensions would
give an aberration blur something like twenty times the width of
Cassini’s division, and the chance of seeing all five satellites
with it would be negligibly small.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span></p>

<p>Further, Hadley presently disclosed to others not only the
method he used in polishing and parabolizing specula, but his
method of testing for true figure by the aberrations disclosed as
he worked the figure away from the sphere—a scheme frequently
used even to this day.</p>

<p>The effect of Hadley’s work was profound. Under his guidance
others began to produce well figured mirrors, in particular
Molyneux and Hawksbee; reflecting telescopes became fairly
common; and in the beginning of the next decade James Short,
(1710-1768), possessed of craftsmanship that approached wizardry,
not only fully mastered the art of figuring the paraboloid,
but at once took up the Gregorian construction with its
ellipsoidal small mirror, with much success.</p>

<p>His specula were of great relative aperture, F/4 to F/6, and
from the excellent quality of his metal some of them have retained
their fine polish and definition after more than a century. He is
said to have gone even up to 12 inches in diameter. His exact
methods of working died with him. Even his tools he ordered
to be destroyed before his death.</p>

<p>The Cassegrain reflector, properly having a parabolic large
mirror and a hyperbolic small one, seems very rarely to have been
made in the eighteenth century, though one certainly came into
the hands of Ramsden (1735-1800).</p>

<p>Few refractors for astronomical use were made after the advent
of the reflector, which was, and is, however, badly suited for the
purposes of a portable spy-glass, owing to trouble from stray
light. The refractor therefore permanently held its own in this
function, despite its length and uncorrected aberrations.</p>

<p>Relief was near at hand, for hardly had Short started on his
notable career when Chester Moor Hall, Esq. (1704-1771) a
gentleman of Essex, designed and caused to be constructed the first
achromatic telescope, with an objective of crown and flint glass.
He is stated to have been studying the problem for several years,
led to it by the erroneous belief (shared by Gregory long before)
that the human eye was an example of an achromatic instrument.</p>

<p>Be this as it may Hall had his telescopes made by George Bast
of London at least as early as 1733, and according to the best
available evidence several instruments were produced, one of them
of above 2 inches aperture on a focal length of about 20 inches
(F/8) and further, subsequently such instruments were made and
sold by Bast and other opticians.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span></p>

<p>These facts are clear and yet, with knowledge of them among
London workmen as well as among Hall’s friends, the invention
made no impression, until it was again brought to light, and
patented, by the celebrated John Dolland (1706-1761) in the
year 1758.</p>

<p>Physical considerations give a clue to this singular neglect.
The only glasses differing materially in dispersion available in
Hall’s day were the ordinary crown, and such flint as was in use
in the glass cutting trade,—what we would now know as a light
flint, and far from homogeneous at that.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_028.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><i>Lodge “Pioneers of Science.”</i><br />
<span class="smcap">Fig. 17.</span>—John Dolland.</div>
</div>

<p>Out of such material it was practically very hard (as the
Dollands quickly found) to make a double objective decently free
from spherical aberration, especially for one working, as Hall quite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
assuredly did, by rule of thumb. With the additional handicap
of flint full of faults it is altogether likely that these first achromatics,
while embodying the correct principles, were not good
enough to make effective headway against the cheaper and
simpler spy-glass of the time.</p>

<p>Dolland, although in 1753 he strongly supported Newton’s
error in a Royal Society paper against Euler’s belief in achromatism,
shifted his view a couple of years later and after a
considerable period of skilful and well ordered experimenting published
his discovery of achromatism early in 1758, for which a
patent was granted him April 19, while in the same year the Royal
Society honored him with the Copley medal. From that time
until his death, late in 1761, he and his son Peter Dolland (1730-1820)
were actively producing achromatic glasses.</p>

<p>The Dollands were admirable craftsmen and their early product
was probably considerably better than were Hall’s objectives but
they felt the lack of suitable flint and soon after John Dolland’s
death, about 1765, the son sought relief in the triple objective of
which an early example is shown in Fig. 18, and
which, with some modifications, was his standard
form for many years.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/i_029.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 18.</span>—Peter Dolland’s Triple Objective.</div>
</div>

<p>Other opticians began to make achromatics,
and, Peter Dolland having threatened action
for infringement, a petition was brought by 35
opticians of London in 1764 for the annulment
of John Dolland’s patent, alleging that he was
not the original inventor but had knowledge
of Chester Moor Hall’s prior work. In the
list was George Bast, who in fact did make
Hall’s objectives twenty five years before
Dolland, and also one Robert Rew of Coldbath
Fields, who claimed in 1755 to have informed Dolland of
the construction of Hall’s objective.</p>

<p>This was just the time when Dolland came to the right about
face on achromatism, and it may well be that from Rew or
elsewhere he may have learned that a duplex achromatic lens
had really been produced. But his Royal Society paper shows
that his result came from honest investigations, and at worst he
is in about the position of Galileo a century and a half before.</p>

<p>The petition apparently brought no action, perhaps because
Peter Dolland next year sued Champneys, one of the signers, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
obtained judgment. It was in this case that the judge (Lord
Camden) delivered the oft quoted dictum: “It was not the
person who locked up his invention in his scrutoire that ought to
profit by a patent for such invention, but he who brought it
forth for the benefit of the public.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>”</p>

<p>This was sound equity enough, assuming the facts to be as
stated, but while Hall did not publish the invention admittedly
made by him, it had certainly become known to many. Chester
Moor Hall was a substantial and respected lawyer, a bencher of
the Inner Temple, and one is inclined to think that his alleged
concealment was purely constructive, in his failing to contest
Dolland’s claim.</p>

<p>Had he appeared at the trial with his fighting blood up, there is
every reason to believe that he could have established a perfectly
good case of public use quite aside from his proof of technical
priority. However, having clearly lost his own claims through
<i>laches</i>, he not improbably was quite content to let the tradesmen
fight it out among themselves. Hall’s telescopes were in
fact known to be in existence as late as 1827.</p>

<p>As the eighteenth century drew toward its ending the reflecting
telescope, chiefly in the Gregorian form, held the field in astronomical
work, the old refractor of many draw tubes was the spy-glass
of popular use, and the newly introduced achromatic was
the instrument of “the exclusive trade.” No glass of suitable
quality for well corrected objectives had been produced, and that
available was not to be had in discs large enough for serious
work. A 3-inch objective was reckoned rather large.</p>

<small>THE MODERN TELESCOPE</small></h2>


<p>The chief link between the old and the new, in instrumental
as well as observational astronomy, was Sir William Herschel
(1738-1822). In the first place he carried the figuring of his
mirrors to a point not approached by his predecessors, and second,
he taught by example the immense value of aperture in definition
and grasp of light. His life has never been adequately written,
but Miss Clerke’s “<i>The Herschels and Modern Astronomy</i>” is
extremely well worth the reading as a record of achievement that
knew not the impossible.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<div class="caption"> <i>Miss Clerke’s Herschel &amp; Modern Astronomy</i> (<i>Macmillan</i>).<br />
<span class="smcap">Fig. 19.</span>—Sir William Herschel.</div>
</div>

<p>He was the son of a capable band-master of Hanover, brought
up as a musician, in a family of exceptional musical abilities,
and in 1757 jumped his military responsibilities and emigrated to
England, to the world’s great gain. For nearly a decade he
struggled upward in his art, taking meanwhile every opportunity
for self education, not only in the theory of music but in mathematics
and the languages, and in 1767 we find him settled in
fashionable Bath, oboist in a famous orchestra, and organist of
the Octagon Chapel. His abilities brought him many pupils,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
and ultimately he became director of the orchestra in which he
had played, and the musical dictator of the famous old resort.</p>

<p>In 1772 came his inspiration in the loan of a 2-foot Gregorian
reflector, and a little casual star-gazing with it. It was the
opening of the kingdom of the skies, and he sought to purchase a
telescope of his own in London, only to find the price too great for
his means. (Even a 2-foot, of 4&frac12; inches aperture, by Short
was listed at five-and-thirty guineas.) Then after some futile
attempts at making a plain refractor he settled down to hard
work at casting and polishing specula.</p>

<p>Although possessed of great mechanical abilities the difficult
technique of the new art long baffled him, and he cast and worked
some 200 small discs in the production of his first successful
telescopes, to say nothing of a still greater number in larger sizes
in his immediately subsequent career.</p>

<p>As time went on he scored a larger proportion of successes,
but at the start good figure seems to have been largely fortuitous.
Inside of a couple of years, however, he had mastered
something of the art and turned out a 5-foot instrument which
seems to have been of excellent quality, followed later by a 7-foot
(aperture 6&frac14; inches) even better, and then by others still bigger.</p>

<p>The best of Herschel’s specula must have been of exquisite
figure. His 7-foot was tested at Greenwich against one of Short’s
of 9&frac12; inches aperture much to the latter’s disadvantage. His
discovery with the 7-foot, of the “Georgium Sidus” (Uranus) in
1781 won him immediate fame and recognition, beside spurring
him to greater efforts, especially in the direction of larger apertures,
of which he had fully grasped the importance.</p>

<p>In 1782 he successfully completed a 12-inch speculum of 20 feet
focus, followed in 1788 by an 18-inch of the same length. The
previous year he first arranged his reflector as a “front view”
telescope—the so-called Herschelian. Up to this time he, except
for a few Gregorians, had used Newton’s oblique mirror.</p>

<p>The heavy loss of light (around 40 per cent) in the second
reflection moved him to tilt the main mirror so as to throw the
focal point to the edge of the aperture where one could look downward
upon the image through the ocular as shown in Fig. 20.
Here <i>SS</i> is the great speculum, <i>O</i> the ocular and <i>i</i> the image
formed near the rim of the tube. In itself the tilting would
seriously impair the definition, but Herschel wisely built his
telescopes of moderate relative aperture (F/10 to F/20), so that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
this difficulty was considerably lessened, while the saving of
light, amounting to nearly a stellar magnitude, was important.</p>

<p>Meanwhile he was hard at work on his greatest mirror, of
48 inches clear aperture and 40 feet focal length, the father of the
great line of modern telescopes. It was finished in the summer of
1789. The speculum was 49&frac12; inches in over-all diameter, 3&frac12;
inches thick and weighed as cast 2118 lbs. The completion of
this instrument, which would rank as large even today, was made
notable by the immediate discovery of two new satellites of
Saturn, Enceladus and Mimas.</p>

<p>It also proved of very great value in sweeping for nebulæ,
but its usefulness seems to have been much limited by the flexure
of the mirror under its great weight, and by its rapid tarnishing.
It required repolishing, which meant refiguring, at least every two
years, a prodigious task.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<img src="images/i_033.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 20.</span>—Herschel’s Front View Telescope.</div>
</div>

<p>It was used as a front view instrument and was arranged as
shown in Fig. 21. Obviously the front view form has against it
the mechanical difficulty of supporting the observer up to quite
the full focal length of the instrument in air, a difficulty vastly
increased were the mount an equatorial one, so that for the great
modern reflectors the Cassegrain form, looked into axially upward,
and in length only a third or a quarter of the principal focus, is
almost universal.</p>

<p>As soon as the excellent results obtained by Herschel became
generally known, a large demand arose for his telescopes, which
he filled in so far as he could spare the time from his regular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
work, and not the least of his services to science was the distribution
of telescopes of high quality and consequent strong stimulus
to general interest in astronomy.</p>

<p>Two of his instruments, of 4-and 7-feet focus respectively, fell
into the worthy hands of Schröter at Lilienthal and did sterling
service in making his great systematic study of the lunar surface.
At the start even Herschel’s 7-foot telescope brought 200 guineas,
and the funds thus won he promptly turned to research.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<div class="caption"><i>Miss Clerke’s Herschel &amp; Modern Astronomy</i> (<i>Macmillan</i>).
<span class="smcap"><br />Fig. 21.</span>—Herschel’s Forty-foot Telescope.</div>
</div>

<p>We sometimes think of the late eighteenth century as a time
of license unbounded and the higher life contemned, but Herschel
wakened a general interest in unapplied science that has hardly
since been equalled and never surpassed. Try to picture social
and official Washington rushing to do honor to some astronomer
who by luck had found the trans-Neptunian planet; the diplomatic
corps crowding his doors, and his very way to the Naval
Observatory blocked by the limousines of the curious and admiring,
and some idea may be gained of what really happened to the
unassuming music master from Bath who suddenly found himself
famous.</p>

<p>Great as were the advances made by Herschel the reflector<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
was destined to fall into disuse for many years. The fact was
that the specula had to be refigured, as in the case of the great 40-foot
telescope, quite too often to meet the requirements of the
ordinary user, professional or amateur. Only those capable of
doing their own figuring could keep their instruments conveniently
in service.</p>

<p>Sir W. Herschel always had relays of specula at hand for his
smaller instruments, and when his distinguished son, Sir John
F. W. Herschel, went on his famous observing expedition to the
Cape of Good Hope in 1834-38 he took along his polishing
machine and three specula for his 20-foot telescope. And he
needed them indeed, for a surface would sometimes go bad
even in a week, and regularly became quite useless in 2 or 3
months.</p>

<p>Makers who used the harder speculum metal, very brittle and
scarcely to be touched by a file, fared better, and some small
mirrors, well cared for, have held serviceable polish for many
years. Many of these instruments of Herschel’s time, too, were
of very admirable performance.</p>

<p>Some of Herschel’s own 7-foot telescopes give evidence of
exquisite figure and he not only commonly used magnifying powers
up to some 80 per inch of aperture, a good stiff figure for a
telescope old or new, but went above 2,000, even nearly to 6,000
on one of his 6&frac12;-inch mirrors without losing the roundness of the
star image. “Empty magnification” of course, gaining no detail
whatever, but evidence of good workmanship.</p>

<p>Many years later the Rev. W. R. Dawes, the famous English
observer, had a 5-inch Gregorian, commonly referred to as “The
Jewel,” on which he used 430 diameters, and pushed to 2,000 on
Polaris without distortion of the disc. Comparing it with a 5-foot
(approximately 4-inch aperture) refractor, he reports the Gregorian
somewhat inferior in illuminating power; “But in
sharpness of definition, smallness of discs of stars, and hardness
of outline of planets it is superior.” All of which shows that
while methods and material may have improved, the elders did
not in the least lack skill.</p>

<p>The next step forward, and a momentous one, was to be taken
in the achromatic refractor. Its general principles were understood,
but clear and homogeneous glass, particularly flint glass,
was not to be had in pieces of any size. “Optical glass,” as we
understand the term, was unknown.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span></p>

<p>It is a curious and dramatic fact that to a single man was due
not only the origin of the art but the optical glass industry of the
world. If the capacity for taking infinite pains be genius, then
the term rightfully belongs to Pierre Louis Guinand. He was a
Swiss artisan living in the Canton of Neuchatel near Chaux-de-Fonds,
maker of bells for repeaters, and becoming interested in
constructing telescopes imported some flint glass from England
and found it bad.</p>

<p>He thereupon undertook the task of making better, and from
1784 kept steadily at his experiments, failure only spurring him
on to redoubled efforts. All he could earn at his trade went into
his furnaces, until gradually he won success, and his glass began
to be heard of; for by 1799 he was producing flawless discs of
flint as much as 6 inches in diameter.</p>

<p>What is more, to Guinand is probably due the production of
the denser, more highly refractive flints, especially valuable for
achromatic telescopes. The making of optical glass has always
been an art rather than a science. It is one thing to know the
exact composition of a glass and quite another to know in what
order and proportion the ingredients went into the furnace, to
what temperature they were carried, and for how long, and just
how the fused mass must be treated to free the products from
bubbles and striæ.</p>

<p>Even today, though much has been learned by scientific investigation
in the past few years, it is far from easy to produce two
consecutive meltings near enough in refractive power to be
treated as optically identical, or to produce large discs optically
homogeneous. What Guinand won by sheer experience was
invaluable. He was persuaded in 1805 to move to Munich and
eventually to join forces with Fraunhofer, an association which
made both the German optical glass industry and the modern
refractor.</p>

<p>He returned to Switzerland in 1814 and continued to produce
perfect discs of larger and larger dimensions. One set of 12 inches
worked up by Cauchoix in Paris furnished what was for some
years the world’s largest refractor.</p>

<p>Guinaud died in 1824, but his son Henry, moving to Paris,
brought his treasure of practical knowledge to the glass works
there, where it has been handed down, in effect from father to
son, gaining steadily by accretion, through successive firms to
the present one of Parra-Mantois.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span></p>

<p>Bontemps, one of the early pupils of Henry Guinand, emigrated
to England at the Revolution of 1848 and brought the art to the
famous firm of Chance in Birmingham. Most of its early secrets
have long been open, but the minute teachings of experience are
a tremendously valuable asset even now.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 22.</span>—Dr. Joseph von Fraunhofer, the Father of Astrophysics.</div>
</div>

<p>To Fraunhofer, the greatest master of applied optics in the
nineteenth century, is due the astronomical telescope in substantially
its present form. Not only did he become under
Guinand’s instruction extraordinarily skillful in glass making
but he practically devised the art of working it with mathematical
precision on an automatic machine, and the science of correctly
designing achromatic objectives.</p>

<p>The form which he originated (Fig. 23) was the first in which
the aberrations were treated with adequate completeness, and,
particularly for small instruments, is unexcelled even now.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
The curvatures here shown are extreme, the better to show their
relations. The front radius of the crown is about 2&frac12; times
longer than the rear radius, the front of the flint is slightly flatter
than the back of the crown, and the rear of the flint is only
slightly convex.</p>

<p>Fraunhofer’s workmanship was of the utmost exactness and it
is not putting the case too strongly to say that a first class example
of the master’s craft, in good condition, would
compare well in color-correction, definition, and
field, with the best modern instruments.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i_038.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 23.</span></div>
</div>

<p>The work done by the elder Struve at Dorpat
with Fraunhofer’s first large telescope (9.6 inches
aperture and 170 inches focal length) tells the
story of its quality, and the Königsberg heliometer,
the first of its class, likewise, while even
today some of his smaller instruments are still doing
good service.</p>

<p>It was he who put in practice the now general
convention of a relative aperture of about F/15,
and standardized the terrestrial eyepiece into the design quite
widely used today. The improvements since his time have been
relatively slight, due mainly to the recent production of varieties
of optical glass unknown a century ago. Fraunhofer was born
in Straubing, Bavaria, March 6, 1787. Self-educated like
Herschel, he attained to an extraordinary combination of
theoretical and practical knowledge that went far in laying the
foundations of astrophysics.</p>

<p>The first mapping of the solar spectrum, the invention of the
diffraction grating and its application to determining the wave
length of light, the first exact investigation of the refraction and
dispersion of glass and other substances, the invention of the
objective prism, and its use in studying the spectra of stars and
planets, the recognition of the correspondence of the sodium lines
to the D lines in the sun, and the earliest suggestion of the
diffraction theory of resolution later worked out by Lord
Rayleigh and Professor Abbé, make a long list of notable
achievements.</p>

<p>To these may be added his perfecting of the achromatic telescope,
the equatorial mounting and its clockwork drive, the
improvement of the heliometer, the invention of the stage mi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>crometer,
several types of ocular micrometers, and the automatic
ruling engine.</p>

<p>He died at the height of his creative powers June 7, 1826, and
lies buried at Munich under the sublime ascription, by none
better earned, <i>Approximavit Sidera</i>.</p>

<p>From Fraunhofer’s time, at the hands of Merz his immediate
successor, Cauchoix in France, and Tully in England, the achromatic
refractor steadily won its way. Reflecting telescopes,
despite the sensational work of Lord Rosse on his 6-foot mirror of
53 feet focus (unequalled in aperture until the 6-foot of the
Dominion Observatory seventy years later), and the even more
successful instrument of Mr. Lassell (4 feet aperture, 39 feet
focus), were passing out of use, for the reason already noted,
that repolishing meant refiguring and the user had to be at once
astronomer and superlatively skilled optician.</p>

<p>These large specula, too, were extremely prone to serious flexure
and could hardly have been used at all except for the equilibrating
levers devised by Thomas Grubb about 1834, and used
effectively on the Rosse instrument. These are in effect a group
of upwardly pressing counterbalanced planes distributing among
them the downward component of the mirror’s weight so as to
keep the figure true in any position of the tube.</p>

<p>Such was the situation in the 50’s of the last century, when the
reflector was quite unexpectedly pushed to the front as a practical
instrument by almost simultaneous activity in Germany and
France. The starting point in each was Liebig’s simple chemical
method of silvering glass, which quickly and easily lays on a thin
reflecting film capable of a beautiful polish.</p>

<p>The honor of technical priority in its application to silvering
telescope specula worked in glass belongs to Dr. Karl August
Steinheil (1801-1870) who produced about the beginning of
1856 an instrument of 4-inch aperture reported to have given
with a power of 100 a wonderfully good image. The publication
was merely from a news item in the “<i>Allgemeine Zeitung</i>”
of Augsburg, March 24, 1856, so it is little wonder that the
invention passed for a time unnoticed.</p>

<p>Early the next year, Feb. 16, 1857, working quite independently,
exactly the same thing was brought before the French Academy
of Sciences by another distinguished physicist, Jean Bernard
Léon Foucault, immortal for his proof of the earth’s rotation by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a><br /><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
the pendulum experiment, his measurement of the velocity of
light, and the discovery of the electrical eddy currents that bear
his name.</p>

The Inventors of the Silver-on-Glass Reflector.</div>
</div>

<p>To Foucault, chiefly, the world owes the development of the
modern silver-on-glass reflector, for not being a professional
optician he had no hesitation in making public his admirable
methods of working and testing, the latter now universally
employed. It is worth noting that his method of figuring was,
physically, exactly what Jesse Ramsden (1735-1800) had pointed
out in 1779, (Phil. Tr. 1779, 427) geometrically. One of
Foucault’s very early instruments mounted equatorially by
Sécrétan is shown in Fig. 26.</p>


<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_041.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 26.</span>—Early Foucault Reflector.</div>
</div>

<p>The immediate result of the admirable work of Steinheil and
Foucault was the extensive use of the new reflector, and its rapid
development as a convenient and practical instrument, especially
in England in the skillful hands of With, Browning, and Calver.
Not the least of its advantages was its great superiority over the
older type in light-grasp, silver being a better reflector than specu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>lum
metal in the ratio of very nearly 7 to 5. From this time on
both refractors and reflectors have been
fully available to the user of telescopes.</p>

<p>In details of construction both have
gained somewhat mechanically. As we
have seen, tubes were often of wood, and
not uncommonly the mountings also. At
the present time metal work of every kind
being more readily available, tubes and
mountings of telescopes of every size are
quite universally of metal, save for the
tripod-legs of the portable instruments.
The tubes of the smaller refractors, say 3 to
5 inches in aperture, are generally of brass,
though in high grade instruments this is
rapidly being replaced by aluminum, which
saves considerable weight. Tubes above 5
or 6 inches are commonly of steel, painted
or lacquered. The beautifully polished
brass of the smaller tubes, easily damaged
and objectionably shiny, is giving way to
a serviceable matt finish in hard lacquer.
Mountings, too, are now more often in
iron and steel or aluminum than in brass,
the first named quite universally in the
working parts, for which the aluminum is
rather soft.</p>

<p>The typical modern refractor, even of
modest size, is a good bit more of a machine
than it looks at first glance. In principle
it is outlined in Fig. 5, in practice it is
much more complex in detail and requires
the nicest of workmanship. In fact if one
were to take completely apart a well-made
small refractor, including its optical
and mechanical parts one would reckon up
some 30 to 40 separate pieces, not counting
screws, all of which must be accurately
fitted and assembled if the instrument is
to work properly.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_042.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 27.</span>—Longitudinal Section of Modern Refractor.</div>
</div>

<p>Fig. 27 shows such an instrument in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
section from end to end, as one would find it could he lay it open
longitudinally.</p>

<p><i>A</i> is the objective cap covering the objective <i>B</i> in its adjustable
cell <i>C</i>, which is squared precisely to the axis of the main tube <i>D</i>.
Looking along this one finds the first of the diaphragms, <i>E</i>.</p>

<p>These are commonly 3 to 6 in number spaced about equally
down the tube, and are far more important than they look.
Their function is not to narrow the beam of light that reaches
the ocular, but to trap light which might enter the tube obliquely
and be reflected from its sides into the ocular, filling it with stray
glare.</p>

<p>No amount of simple blackening will answer the purpose, for
even dead black paint such as opticians use reflects at very oblique
incidence quite 10 to 20 per cent of the beam. The importance
of both diaphragms and thorough blackening has been
realized for at least a century and a half, and one can hardly
lay too much stress upon the matter.</p>

<p>The diaphragms should be so proportioned that, when looking
up the tube from the edge of an aperture of just the size and position
of the biggest lens in the largest eyepiece, no part of the
edge of the objective is cut off, and no part of the side of the
tube is visible beyond the nearest diaphragm.</p>

<p>Going further down the tube past a diaphragm or two one
comes to the clamping screws <i>F</i>. These serve to hold the instrument
to its mounting. They may be set in separate bases
screwed in place on the inside of the tube, or may be set in the
two ends of a lengthwise strap thus secured. They are placed at
the balance point as nearly as may be, generally nearer the eye
end than the objective.</p>

<p>Then, after one or more diaphragms, comes the guide ring <i>G</i>,
which steadies the main draw tube <i>H</i>, and the rack <i>I</i> by which it
is moved for the focussing in turning the milled head of the pinion
<i>J</i>. The end ring <i>K</i> of the main tube furnishes the other bearing
of <i>H</i>, and both <i>G</i> and <i>K</i> are commonly recessed for accurately
fitted cloth lining rings <i>L</i>, <i>L</i>, to give the draw tube the necessary
smoothness of motion.</p>

<p>For the same reason <i>I</i> and <i>J</i> have to be cut and fitted with the
utmost exactness so as to work evenly and without backlash.
<i>H</i> is fitted at its outer end with a slide ring and tube <i>M</i>, generally
again cloth lined to steady the sliding eyepiece tube <i>N</i>. This is
terminated by the spring collar <i>O</i>, in which fits the eyepiece <i>P</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
generally of the two lens form; and finally comes the eyepiece cap
<i>Q</i> set at the proper distance from the eye lens and with an aperture
of carefully determined size.</p>

<p>One thus gets pretty well down in the alphabet without going
much into the smaller details of construction. Both objective
mount and ocular are somewhat complex in fact, and the former
is almost always made adjustable in instruments of above 3 or
4 inches aperture, as shown in Fig. 28, the form used by Cooke, the
famous maker of York, England. Unless the optical axis of the
objective is true with the tube bad images result.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_044.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 28.</span>—Adjustable Cell for Objective.</div>
</div>

<p>To the upper end of the tube is fitted a flanged counter-cell
<i>c</i>, to an outward flange <i>f</i>, tapped for 3 close pairs of adjusting
screws as <i>s</i><sub>1</sub>, <i>s</i><sub>11</sub> spaced at 120° apart. The objective cell itself,
<i>b</i>, is recessed for the objective which is held in place by an
interior or exterior ring <i>d</i>. The two lenses of the achromatic
objective are usually very slightly separated by spacers, either
tiny bits of tinfoil 120° apart, or a very thin ring with its upper
edge cut down save at 3 points.</p>

<p>This precaution is to insure that the lenses are quite uniformly
supported instead of touching at uncertain points, and quite
usually the pair as a whole rests below on three corresponding
spacers. Of each pair of adjusting screws one as 1 in the pair <i>s</i><sub>11</sub>
is threaded to push the counter cell out, the adjacent one, 2, to pull
it in, so that when adjustment is made the objective is firmly held.
Of the lenses that form the objective, the concave flint is commonly
at the rear and the convex crown in front.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span></p>

<p>At the eye end the ocular ordinarily consists of two lenses
each burnished into a brass screw ring, a tube, flange, cap, and
diaphragm arranged as shown in Fig. 29. There are many
varieties of ocular as will presently be shown, but this is a typical
form. Figure 30 shows a complete modern refractor of four
inches aperture on a portable equatorial stand with slow motion
in right ascension and diagonal eye piece.</p>

<p>Reflectors, used in this country less than they deserve, are,
when properly mounted, likewise possessed of many parts. The
smaller ones, such as are likely to come into the reader’s hands,
are almost always in the Newtonian form, with a small oblique
mirror to bring the image outside the tube.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 29.</span>—The Eye-Piece and its Fittings.</div>
</div>

<p>The Gregorian form has entirely vanished. Its only special
merit was its erect image, which gave it high value as a terrestrial
telescope before the days of achromatics, but from its
construction it was almost impossible to keep the field from being
flooded with stray light, and the achromatic soon displaced it.
The Cassegranian construction on the other hand, shorter and
with aberrations much reduced, has proved important for obtaining
long equivalent focus in a short mount, and is almost universally
applied to large reflectors, for which a Newtonian mirror
is also generally provided.</p>

<p>Figure 31 shows in section a typical reflector of the Newtonian
form. Here <i>A</i> is the main tube, fitted near its outer end with a
ring <i>B</i> carrying the small elliptical mirror <i>C</i>, which is set at 45°
to the axis of the tube. At the bottom of the tube is the parabolic
main mirror <i>D</i>, mounted in its cell <i>E</i>. Just opposite the
45° small mirror is a hole in the tube to which is fitted the eye<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
piece mounting <i>F</i>, carrying the eyepiece <i>G</i>, fitted to a spring
collar <i>H</i>, screwed into a draw tube <i>I</i>, sliding in its mounting and
brought to focus by the rack-and-pinion <i>J</i>.</p>

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 30.</span>—Portable Equatorial Refractor (Brashear).</div>
</div>

<p>At <i>K</i>, <i>K</i>, are two rings fixed to the tube and bearing smoothly
against the rings <i>L L</i> rigidly fixed to the bar <i>M</i> carried by the
polar axis of the mount. The whole tube can therefore be rotated
about its axis so as to bring the eye piece into a convenient posi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a><br /><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>tion
for observation. One or more handles, <i>N</i>, are provided for
this purpose.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

</div>

<p>Brackets shown in dotted lines at <i>O</i>, <i>O</i>, carry the usual finder,
and a hinged door <i>P</i> near the lower end of the tube enables one to
remove or replace the close fitting metal cover that protects the
main mirror when not in use. Similarly a cover is fitted to the
small mirror, easily reached from the upper end of the tube. The
proportions here shown are approximately those commonly
found in medium sized instruments, say 7 to 10 inches aperture.
The focal ratio is somewhere about <i>F</i>/6, the diagonal mirror is
inside of focus by about the diameter of the main mirror, and
its minor axis is from ⅕ to &frac14; that diameter.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_048.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 32.</span>—Reflector with Skeleton Tube (Brashear).</div>
</div>
<p>Note that the tube is not provided with diaphragms. It
is merely blackened as thoroughly as possible, although stray
light is quite as serious here as in a refractor. One could fit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
diaphragms effectively only in a tube of much larger diameter
than the mirror, which would be inconvenient in many
ways.</p>

<p>A much better way of dealing with the difficulty is shown in Fig.
32 in which the tube is reduced to a skeleton, a construction common
in large instruments. Nothing is blacker than a clear
opening into the darkness of night, and in addition there can be
no localized air currents, which often injure definition in an ordinary
tube.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/i_049.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 33.</span></div>
</div>

<p>Instruments by different makers vary somewhat in detail. A
good type of mirror mounting is
that shown in Fig. 33, and used
for many years past by Browning,
one of the famous English makers.
Here the mirror <i>A</i>, the back of
which is made accurately plane,
is seated in its counter-cell <i>B</i>, of
which a wide annulus <i>F</i>, <i>F</i>, is also a good plane, and is lightly held
in place by a retaining ring. This counter cell rests in the outer
cell <i>C</i> on three equidistant studs regulated by the concentric
push-and-pull adjusting screws <i>D</i>, <i>D</i>, <i>E</i>, <i>E</i>. The outer cell
may be solid, or a skeleton for lightness and better equalization
of temperature.</p>

<p>Small specula may be well supported on any flat surface substantial
enough to be thoroughly rigid, with one or more thicknesses
of soft, thick, smooth cloth between, best of all Brussels
carpet. Such was the common method of support in instruments
of moderate dimensions prior to the day of glass specula. Sir
John Herschel speaks of thus carrying specula of more than a
hundred-weight, but something akin to Browning’s plan is
generally preferable.</p>

<p>There is also considerable variety in the means used for supporting
the small mirror centrally in the tube. In the early
telescopes it was borne by a single stiff arm which was none too
stiff and produced by diffraction a long diametral flaring ray in
the images of bright stars.</p>

<p>A great improvement was introduced by Browning more than
a half century ago, in the support shown in Fig. 34. Here the
ring <i>A</i>, (<i>B</i>, Fig. 31) carries three narrow strips of thin spring
steel, <i>B</i>, extending radially inward to a central hub which carries
the mirror <i>D</i>, on adjusting screws <i>E</i>. Outside the ring the ten<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>sion
screws <i>C</i> enable the mirror to be accurately centered and
held in place. Rarely, the mirror is replaced by a totally reflecting
right angled prism which saves some light, but unless for
small instruments is rather heavy and hard to obtain of the requisite
quality and precision of figure. A typical modern reflector
by Brashear, of 6 inches aperture, is shown in Fig. 35, complete
with circles and driving clock, the latter contained in the hollow
iron pier, an arrangement usual in American-made instruments.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_050.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 34.</span>—Support of Diagonal Mirror (Browning.)</div>
</div>

<p>Recent reflectors, particularly in this country, have four supporting
strips instead of three, which gives a little added stiffness,
and produces in star images but four diffraction rays instead of
the six produced by the three strip arrangement, each strip
giving a diametral ray.</p>

<p>In some constructions the ring <i>A</i> is arranged to carry the eyepiece
fittings, placed at the very end of the tube and arranged for
rotating about the optical axis of the telescope. This allows the
ocular to be brought to any position without turning the whole
tube. In small instruments a fixed eyepiece can be used without
much inconvenience if located on the north side of the tube (in
moderate north latitudes).</p>

<p>Reflectors are easily given a much greater relative aperture
than is practicable in a single achromatic objective. In fact
they are usually given apertures of <i>F</i>/5 to <i>F</i>/8 and now and then
are pushed to or even below <i>F</i>/3. Such mirrors have been
successfully used for photography;<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> and less frequently for visual
observation, mounted in the Cassegranian form, which commonly
increases the virtual focal length at least three or four times. A
telescope so arranged, with an aperture of a foot or more as in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
some recent examples, makes a very powerful and compact
instrument.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_051.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 35.</span>—Small Equatorially Mounted Reflector.</div>
</div>

<p>This is the form commonly adopted for the large reflectors of
recent construction, a type being the 60-inch telescope of the
Mount Wilson Observatory of which the primary focus is 25&frac14;
feet and the ordinary equivalent focus as a Cassegranian 80
feet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span></p>

<p>Comparatively few small reflectors have been made or used
in the United States, although the climatic conditions here are
more favorable than in England, where the reflector originated
and has been very fully developed. The explanation may lie
in our smaller number of non-professional active astronomers
who are steadily at observational work, and can therefore use
reflectors to the best advantage.</p>

<p>The relative advantages of refractors and reflectors have
long been a matter of acrimonious dispute. In fact, more of the
genuine <i>odium theologicum</i> has gone into the consideration of this
matter than usually attaches to differences in scientific opinion.
A good many misunderstandings have been due to the fact that
until recently few observers were practically familiar with both
instruments, and the professional astronomer was a little inclined
to look on the reflector as fit only for amateurs. The comparison
is somewhat clarified at present by the fact that the old speculum
metal reflector has passed out of use, and the case now stands as
between the ordinary refracting telescope such as has just been
described, and the silver-on-glass reflector discussed immediately
thereafter.</p>

<p>The facts in the case are comparatively simple. Of two
telescopes having the same clear aperture, one a reflector and the
other a refractor, each assumed to be thoroughly well figured, as it
can be in fact today, the theoretical resolving power is the same,
for this is determined merely by the aperture, so that the only
possible difference between the two would be in the residual imperfection
in the performance of the refractor due to its not being
perfectly achromatic. This difference is substantially a negligible
one for many, but not all, purposes.</p>

<p>Likewise, the general definition of the pair, assuming first-class
workmanship, would be equal. Of the two, the single
surface of the mirror is somewhat more difficult to figure with the
necessary precision than is any single surface of the refractor, but
reflectors can be, and are, given so perfect a parabolic figure that
the image is in no wise inferior to that produced by the best
refractors, and the two types of telescopes will stand under
favorable circumstances the same proportional magnifying
powers.</p>

<p>The mirror is much more seriously affected by changes of
temperature and by flexure than is the objective, since in the
former case the successive surfaces of the two lenses in the achro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>matic
combination to a considerable extent compensate each
other’s slight changes of curvature, which act only by still slighter
changes of refraction, while the mirror surface stands alone and
any change in curvature produces double the defect on the reflected
ray.</p>

<p>It is therefore necessary, as we shall see presently, to take
particular precautions in working with a reflecting telescope,
which is, so to speak, materially more tender as regards external
conditions than the refractor. As regards light-grasp, the power
of rendering faint objects visible, there is more room for honest
variety of opinion. It was often assumed in earlier days that a
reflector was not much brighter than a refractor of half the
aperture, <i>i.e.</i>, of one quarter the working area.</p>

<p>This might have been true in the case of an old speculum metal
reflector in bad condition, but is certainly a libel on the silver-on-glass
instrument, which Foucault on the other hand claimed to be,
aperture for aperture, brighter than the refractor. Such a
relation might in fact temporarily exist, but it is far from
typical.</p>

<p>The real relation depends merely on the light losses demonstrably
occurring in the two types of telescopes. These are now
quite well known. The losses in a refractor are those due to
absorption of light in the two lenses, plus those due to the four
free surfaces of these lenses. The former item in objectives of
moderate size aggregates hardly more than 2 to 3 per cent.
The latter, assuming the polish to be quite perfect, amount to
18 to 20 per cent of the incident light, for the glasses commonly
used.</p>

<p>The total light transmitted is therefore not over 80 per cent
of the whole, more often somewhat under this figure. For
example, a test by Steinheil of one of Fraunhofer’s refractors
gave a transmission of 78 per cent, and other tests show similar
results.</p>

<p>The relation between the light transmitted by glass of various
thickness is very simple. If unit thickness transmits m per cent
of the incident light then n units in thickness will pass m<sup>n</sup> per
cent. Thus if one half inch passes .98, two inches will transmit
.98<sup>4</sup>, or .922. Evidently the bigger the objective the greater the
absorptive loss. If the loss by reflection at a single surface
leaves m per cent to be transmitted then n surfaces will transmit
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>m<sup>n</sup>. And m being usually about .95, the four surfaces of an objective
let pass nearly .815, and the thicker objective as a whole
transmits approximately 75 per cent.</p>

<p>As to the reflector the whole relation hinges on the coefficient
of reflection from a silvered surface, under the circumstances of
the comparison.</p>

<p>In the case of a reflecting telescope as a whole, there are
commonly two reflections from silver and if the coefficient of
reflection is m then the total light reflected is m². Now the
reflectivity of a silver-on-glass film has been repeatedly measured.
(Chant Ap. J. <b>21</b>, 211) found values slightly in excess of 95
per cent, Rayleigh (Sci. Papers <b>2, 4</b>) got 93.9, Zeiss (Landolt u.
Bornstein, Tabellen) about 93.0 for light of average wave
length.</p>

<p>Taking the last named value, a double reflection would return
substantially 86.5 per cent of the incident light. No allowance
is here made for any effect of selective reflection, since for the
bright visual rays, which alone we are considering, there is very
slight selective effect. In the photographic case it must be
taken into account, and the absorption in glass becomes a
serious factor in the comparison, amounting for the photographic
rays to as much as 30 to 40 per cent in large instruments. Now
in comparing reflector and refractor one must subtract the
light stopped by the small mirror and its supports, commonly
from 5 to 7 per cent. One is therefore forced to the conclusion
that with silver coatings fresh and very carefully polished
reflector and refractor will show for equal aperture equal light
grasp.</p>

<p>But as things actually go even fresh silver films are quite often
below .90 in reflectivity and in general tarnish rather rapidly,
so that in fact the reflector falls below the refractor by just about
the amount by which the silver films are out of condition. For
example Chant (loc. cit.) found after three months his reflectivity
had fallen to .69. A mirror very badly tarnished by fifteen weeks
of exposure to dampness and dust, uncovered, was found by the
writer down to a scant .40.</p>

<p>The line of Fig. 36 shows the relative equivalent apertures of
refractors corresponding to a 10 inch reflector at coefficients of
reflection for a single silvered surface varying from .95 to .50 at
which point the film would be so evidently bad as to require immediate
renewal. The relation is obviously linear when the
transmission of the objective is, as here, assumed constant. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
estimates of skilled observers from actual comparisons fall in well
with the line, showing reflectivities generally around .80 to .85
for well polished films in good condition.</p>

<p>The long and short of the situation is that a silvered reflector
deteriorates and at intervals varying from a few months to a year
or two depending on situation, climate, and usage, requires
repolishing or replacement of the film. This is a fussy job, but
quickly done if everything goes well.</p>

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 36.</span>—Relative Light-grasp of Reflector and Refractor.</div>
</div>

<p>As to working field the reflector as ordinarily proportioned is at
a disadvantage chiefly because it works at <i>F</i>/5 or <i>F</i>/6 instead of
at <i>F</i>/15. At equal focal ratios there is no substantial difference
between reflector and refractor in this respect, unless one goes
into special constructions, as in photographic telescopes.</p>

<p>In two items, first cost and convenience in observing, the
reflector has the advantage in the moderate sizes. Roughly,
the reflector simply mounted costs about one half to a quarter the
refractor of equal light grasp and somewhat less resolving power,
the discrepancy getting bigger in large instruments (2 feet aperture
and upwards).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span></p>

<p>As to case of observing, the small refractor is a truly neck-wringing
instrument for altitudes above 45° or thereabouts, just
the situation in which the equivalent reflector is most convenient.
In considering the subject of mounts these relations will appear
more clearly.</p>

<p>Practically the man who is observing rather steadily and can
give his telescope a fixed mount can make admirable use of a
reflector and will not find the perhaps yearly or even half yearly
re-silvering at all burdensome after he has acquired the knack—chiefly
cleanliness and attention to detail.</p>

<p>If, like many really enthusiastic amateurs, he can get only an
occasional evening for observing, and from circumstances has to
use a portable mount set up on his lawn, or even roof, when
fortune favors an evening’s work, he will find a refractor always
in condition, easy to set up, and requiring a minimum of time to
get into action. The reflector is much the more tender instrument,
with, however, the invaluable quality of precise achromatism,
to compensate for the extra care it requires for its best
performance. It suffers more than the refractor, as a rule, from
scattered light, for imperfect polish of the film gives a field
generally presenting a brighter background than the field of a
good objective. After all the preference depends greatly on the
use to which the telescope is to be put. For astrophysical work
in general, Professor George E. Hale, than whom certainly no one
is better qualified to judge, emphatically endorses the reflector.
Most large observatories are now-a-days equipped with both
refractors and reflectors.</p>

<small>OPTICAL GLASS AND ITS WORKING</small></h2>


<p>Glass, one of the most remarkable and useful products of
man’s devising, had an origin now quite lost in the mists of
antiquity. It dates back certainly near a thousand years before
the Christian era, perhaps many centuries more. Respecting its
origin there are only traditions of the place, quite probably Syria,
and of the accidental melting together of sand and soda. The
product, sodium silicate, readily becomes a liquid, i.e., “water-glass,”
but the elder Pliny, who tells the story, recounts the later
production of a stable vitreous body by the addition of a mineral
which was probably a magnesia limestone.</p>

<p>This combination would give a good permanent glass, whether
the story is true or not, and very long before Pliny’s time glass
was made in great variety of composition and color. In fact
in default of porcelain glass was used in Roman times relatively
more than now. But without knowledge of optics there was no
need for glass of optical quality, it was well into the Renaissance
before its manufacture had reached a point where anything of the
sort could be made available even in small pieces, and it is barely
over a century since glass-making passed beyond the crudest
empiricism.</p>

<p>Glass is substantially a solid solution of silica with a variety of
metallic oxides, chiefly those of sodium, potassium, calcium and
lead, sometimes magnesium, boron, zinc, barium and others.</p>

<p>By itself silica is too refractory to work easily, though
silica glass has some very valuable properties, and the alkaline
oxides in particular serve as the fluxes in common use. Other
oxides are added to obtain various desired properties, and some
impurities may go with them.</p>

<p>The melted mixture is thus a somewhat complex solution containing
frequently half a dozen ingredients. Each has its own
natural melting and vaporizing point, so that while the blend
remains fairly uniform it may tend to lose some constituent while
molten, or in cooling to promote the crystallization of another, if
held too near its particular freezing point. Some combinations are
more likely to give trouble from this cause than others, and while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
a very wide variety of oxides can be coerced into solution with
silica, a comparatively limited number produce a homogeneous
and colorless glass useful for optical purposes.</p>

<p>Many mixtures entirely suitable for common commercial purposes
are out of the question for lens making, through tendency
to surface deterioration by weathering, lack of homogeneous
quality, or objectionable coloration. A very small amount of
iron in the sand used at the start gives the green tinge familiar
in cheap bottles, which materially decreases the transparency.
The bottle maker often adds oxide of manganese to the mixture,
which naturally of itself gives the glass a pinkish tinge, and so
apparently whitens it by compensating the one absorption by
another. The resulting glass looks all right on a casual glance,
but really cuts off a very considerable amount of light.</p>

<p>A further difficulty is that glass differs very much in its degree
of fluidity, and its components sometimes seem to undergo mutual
reactions that evolve persistent fine bubbles, besides reacting
with the fireclay of the melting pot and absorbing impurities
from it.</p>

<p>The molten glass is somewhat viscous and far from homogeneous.
Its character suggests thick syrup poured into water, and
producing streaks and eddies of varying density. Imagine such a
mixture suddenly frozen, and you have a good idea of a common
condition in glass, transparent, but full of striæ. These are
frequent enough in poor window glass, and are almost impossible
completely to get rid of, especially in optical glass of some of the
most valuable varieties.</p>

<p>The great improvement introduced by Guinand was constant
stirring of the molten mass with a cylinder of fire clay, bringing
bubbles to the surface and keeping the mass thoroughly mixed
from its complete fusion until, very slowly cooling, it became too
viscous to stir longer.</p>

<p>The fine art of the process seems to be the exact combination of
temperature, time, and stirring, suitable for each composition
of the glass. There are, too, losses by volatilization during
melting, and even afterwards, that must be reckoned with in the
proportions of the various materials put into the melting, and in
the temperatures reached and maintained.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span></p>

<p>One cannot deduce accurately the percentage mixture of the
raw materials from an analysis of the glass, and it is notorious
that the product even of the best manufacturers not infrequently
fails to run quite true to type. Therefore the optical properties
of each melting have carefully to be ascertained, and the product
listed either as a very slight variant from its standard type, or
as an odd lot, useful, but quite special in properties. Some of
these odd meltings in fact have optical peculiarities the regular
reproduction of which would be very desirable.</p>

<p>The purity of the materials is of the utmost importance in
producing high grade glass for optical or other purposes. The
silica is usually introduced in the form of the purest of white
sand carrying only a few hundredths of one per cent of impurities
in the way of iron, alumina and alkali. The ordinary alkalis
go in preferably as carbonates, which can be obtained of great
purity; although in most commercial glass the soda is used in the
form of “salt-cake,” crude sodium sulphate.</p>

<p>Calcium, magnesium, and barium generally enter the melt as
carbonates, zinc and lead as oxides. Alumina, like iron, is generally
an impurity derived from felspar in the sand, but occasionally
enters intentionally as pure natural felspar, or as chemically
prepared hydrate. A few glasses contain a minute amount of
arsenic, generally used in the form of arsenious acid, and still
more rarely other elements enter, ordinarily as oxides.</p>

<p>Whatever the materials, they are commonly rather fine ground
and very thoroughly mixed, preferably by machinery, before
going into the furnaces. Glass furnaces are in these days commonly
gas fired, and fall into two general classes, those in which
the charge is melted in a huge tank above which the gas flames
play, and those in which the charge is placed in crucibles or pots
open or nearly closed, directly heated by the gas. In the tank
furnaces the production is substantially continuous, the active
melting taking place at one end, where the materials are introduced,
while the clear molten glass flows to the cooler end of the
tank or to a cooler compartment, whence it is withdrawn for
working.</p>

<p>The ordinary method of making optical glass is by a modification
of the pot process, each pot being fired separately to permit
better regulation of the temperature.</p>

<p>The pots themselves are of the purest of fire clay, of moderate
capacity, half a ton or so, and arched over to protect the contents<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
from the direct play of the gases, leaving a side opening sufficient
for charging and stirring.</p>

<p>The fundamental difference between the making of optical
glass and the ordinary commercial varieties lies in the individual
treatment of each charge necessary to secure uniformity and regularity,
carried even to the extent of cooling each melting very
slowly in its own pot, which is finally broken up to recover the
contents. The tank furnaces are under heat week in and week
out, may hold several hundred tons, and on this account cannot
so readily be held to exactness of composition and quality.</p>

<p>The optical glass works, too, is provided with a particularly
efficient set of preheating and annealing kilns, for the heat treatment
of pots and glass must be of the most careful and thorough
kind.</p>

<p>The production of a melting of optical glass begins with a very
gradual heating of the pot to a bright red heat in one of the kilns.
It is then transferred to its furnace which has been brought to a
similar temperature, sealed in by slabs of firebrick, leaving its
mouth easy of access, and then the heat is pushed up to near
the melting temperature of the mixture in production, which
varies over a rather wide range, from a moderate white heat
to the utmost that a regenerative gas furnace can conveniently
produce. After the heating comes the rather careful process of
charging.</p>

<p>The mixture is added a portion at a time, since the fused
material tends to foam, and the raw material as a solid is more
bulky than the fluid. The chemical reactions as the mass fuses
are somewhat complex. In their simplest form they represent
the formation of silicates.</p>

<p>At high temperatures the silica acts as a fairly strong acid, and
decomposes the fused carbonates of sodium and potassium with
evolution of gas. This is the <i>rationale</i> of the fluxing action of
such alkaline substances of rather low melting point. Other
mixtures act somewhat analogously but in a fashion commonly
too complex to follow.</p>

<p>The final result is a thick solution, and the chief concern of
the optical glass maker is to keep it homogeneous, free from
bubbles, and as nearly colorless as practicable. To the first two
ends the temperature is pushed up to gain fluidity, and frequently
substances are added (e.g., arsenic) which by volatility or chemical
effect tend to form large bubbles from the entrained gases, cap<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>able
of clearing themselves from the fluid where fine bubbles
would remain. For the same purpose is the stirring process.</p>

<p>The stirrer is a hard baked cylinder of fire clay fastened to an
iron bar. First heated in the mouth of the pot, the stirrer is
plunged in the molten glass and given a steady rotating motion,
the long bar being swivelled and furnished with a wooden handle
for the workman. This stirring is kept up pretty steadily while
the heat is very slowly reduced until the mass is too thick to manage,
the process taking, for various mixtures and conditions, from
three or four hours to the better part of a day.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_061.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 37.</span>—Testing Optical Glass in the Rough.</div>
</div>

<p>Then begins the careful and tedious process of cooling. Fairly
rapid until the mass is solid enough to prevent the formation of
fresh striæ, the cooling is continued more slowly, in the furnace
or after removal to the annealing oven, until the crucible is cool
enough for handling, the whole process generally taking a week or
more.</p>

<p>Then the real trouble begins. The crucible is broken away
and there is found a more or less cracked mass of glass, sometimes
badly broken up, again furnishing a clear lump weighing some
hundreds of pounds. This glass is then carefully picked over and
examined for flaws, striæ and other imperfections.</p>

<p>These can sometimes be chipped away with more or less breaking
up of the mass. The inspection of the glass in the raw is
facilitated by the scheme shown in elevation Fig. 37. Here <i>A</i> is a
tank with parallel sides of plate glass. In it is placed <i>B</i> the
rough block of glass, and the tank is then filled with a liquid
which can be brought to the same refractive power as the glass,
as in Newton’s disastrous experiment. When equality is reached
for, say, yellow light, one can see directly through the block, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
rays no longer being refracted at its surface, and any interior
striæ are readily seen even in a mass a foot or more thick. Before
adding the liquid a ray would be skewed, as <i>C</i>, <i>D</i>, <i>E</i>, <i>F</i>, afterwards
it would go straight through; <i>C</i>, <i>D</i>, <i>G</i>, <i>H</i>.</p>

<p>The fraction that passes inspection may be found to be from
much less than a quarter to a half of the whole. This good glass
is then ready for the next operation, forming and fine annealing.
The final form to be reached is a disc or block, and the chunks of
perfect glass are heated in a kiln until plastic, and then moulded
into the required shapes, sometimes concave or convex discs
suitable for small lenses.</p>

<p>Then the blocks are transferred to a kiln and allowed to cool
off very gradually, for several days or weeks according to the size
of the blocks and the severity of the requirements they must
meet. In the highest class of work the annealing oven has
thermostatic control and close watch is kept by the pyrometer.</p>

<p>It is clear that the chance of getting a large and perfect
chunk from the crucible is far smaller than that of getting fragments
of a few pounds, so that the production of a perfect disc
for a large objective requires both skill and luck. Little wonder
therefore that the price of discs for the manufacture of objectives
increases substantially as the cube of the diameter.</p>

<p>The process of optical glass making as here described is the
customary one, used little changed since the days of Guinand.
The great advances of the last quarter century have been in the
production of new varieties having certain desirable qualities, and
in a better understanding of the conditions that bring a uniform
product of high quality. During the world war the greatly
increased demand brought most extraordinary activity in the
manufacture, and especially in the scientific study of the problems
involved, both here and abroad. The result has been a long
step toward quantity production, the discovery that modifications
of the tank process could serve to produce certain varieties
of optical glass of at least fair quality, and great improvements in
the precision and rapidity of annealing.</p>

<p>These last are due to the use of the electric furnace, the study
of the strains during annealing under polarized light, and scientific
pyrometry. It is found that cooling can be much hastened
over certain ranges of temperature, and the total time required
very greatly shortened. It has also been discovered, thanks to
captured instruments, that some of the glasses commonly regarded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
as almost impossible to free from bubbles have in fact yielded to
improved methods of treatment.</p>

<p>Conventionally optical glass is of two classes, crown and
flint. Originally the former was a simple compound of silica
with soda and potash, sometimes also lime or magnesia, while the
latter was rich in lead oxide and with less of alkali. The crown
had a low index of refraction and small dispersion, the flint a
high index and strong dispersion. Crown glass was the material
of general use, while the flint glass was the variety used in cut
glass manufacture by reason of its brilliancy due to the qualities
just noted.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_063.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 38.</span>—The Index of Refraction.</div>
</div>

<p>The refractive index is the ratio between the sine of the angle
of incidence on a lens surface and that of the angle of refraction
in passing the surface. Fig. 38 shows the relation of the incident
and refracted rays in passing from air into the glass lens
surface <i>L</i>, and the sines of the angles which determine n, the conventional
symbol for the index of refraction. Here <i>i</i> is the angle of
incidence and <i>r</i> the angle of refraction i.e. n = <i>s</i>/<i>s′</i>. The indices
of refraction are usually given for specific colors representing
certain lines in the spectrum, commonly <i>A</i>¹, the potassium line
in the extreme red, <i>C</i> the red line due to hydrogen, <i>D</i> the sodium
line, <i>F</i> the blue hydrogen line and <i>G′</i> the blue-violet line hydrogen
line, and are distinguished as n<sub><i>c</i></sub>, n<sub><i>d</i></sub>, n<sub><i>f</i></sub>, etc. The standard dispersion
(dn) for visual rays is given as between <i>C</i> and <i>F</i>, while the
standard refractivity is taken for <i>D</i>, in the bright yellow part
of the spectrum. (Note. For the convenience of those who are
rusty on their trigonometry, Fig. 39 shows the simpler trigonometric
functions of an angle. Thus the sine of the angle <i>A</i> is,
numerically, the length of the radius divided into the length of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
the line dropped from the end of the radius to the horizontal
base line, i.e. <i>bc</i>/<i>Ob</i>, the tangent is <i>da</i>/<i>Ob</i>, and the cosine <i>Oc</i>/<i>Ob</i>.)</p>

<p>Ordinarily the index of refraction of the crown was taken as
about 3/2, that of the flint as about 8/5. As time has gone on
and especially since the new glasses from the Jena works were
introduced about 35 years ago, one cannot define crowns and
flints in any such simple fashion, for there are crowns of high
index and flints of low dispersion.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_064.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.39.</span>—The Simple Trigonometric Functions of an Angle.</div>
</div>

<p>The following table gives the optical data and chemical analyses
of a few typical optical glasses. The list includes common
crowns and flints, a typical baryta crown and light flint, and a
telescope crown and flint for the better achromatization of objectives,
as developed at the Jena works.</p>

<p>The thing most conspicuous here as distinguishing crowns from
flints is that the latter have greater relative dispersion in the
blue, the former in the red end of the spectrum, as shown by the
bracketed ratios. This as we shall see is of serious consequence
in making achromatic objectives. In general, too, the values of
ν for flints are much lower than for crowns, and the indices of
refraction themselves commonly higher.</p>

<p>As we have just seen, glass comes to the optician in blocks
or discs, for miscellaneous use the former, three or four inches
square and an inch think, more or less; for telescope making the
latter. The discs are commonly some ten percent greater in
diameter than the finished objective for which they are intended,
and in thickness from 1/8 to 1/10 the diameter. They are commonly
well annealed and given a preliminary polish on both sides
to facilitate close inspection.</p>

<p>The first step toward the telescope is the testing of these discs
of glass, first for the presence or absence of striæ and other
imperfections; second, for the perfection of the annealing. The
maker has usually looked out for all the grosser imperfections
before the discs left his works, but a much closer inspection is
needed in order to make the best use of the glass.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_066a.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 40.</span>—Testing Glass for Striæ.</div>
</div>

<p>Bad striæ are of course seen easily, as they would be in a
window pane, but such gross imperfections are often in reality
less damaging than the apparently slighter ones which must be
searched for. The simplest test is to focus a good telescope on
an artificial star, remove the eyepiece and bring the eye into its
place.</p>

<p>When the eye is in focus the whole aperture of the objective
is uniformly filled with light, and if the disc to be tested be placed
in front of it, any inequality in refraction will announce itself by
an inequality of illumination. A rough judgment as to the seriousness
of the defect may be formed from the area affected and
the amount by which it affects the local intensity of illumination.
Fig. 40 shows the arrangement for the test, <i>A</i> being the eye, <i>B</i> the
objective and <i>C</i> the disc. The artificial star is conveniently
made by setting a black bottle in the sun a hundred feet or so
away and getting the reflection from its shoulder.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_066b.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 41.</span>—The Mirror Test for Striæ.</div>
</div>

<p>A somewhat more delicate test, very commonly used, is shown
in Fig. 41. Here <i>A</i> is a truly spherical mirror silvered on the
front. At <i>B</i> very close to its centre of curvature is placed a lamp
with a screen in front of it perforated with a hole 1/32 inch or so
in diameter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span></p>

<p>The rays reflected from the mirror come back quite exactly
upon themselves and when the eye is placed at <i>C</i>, their reflected
focus, the whole mirror <i>A</i> is uniformly lighted just as the lens
was in Fig. 40, with the incidental advantage that it is much easier
and cheaper to obtain a spherical mirror for testing a sizeable
disc than an objective of similar size and quality. Now placing
the disc <i>D</i> in front of the mirror, the light passing twice through
it shows up the slightest stria or other imperfection as a streak
or spot in the field. Its place is obvious and can be at once
marked on the glass, but its exact position in the substance of the
disc is not so obvious.</p>

<p>To determine this, which may indicate that the fault can be
ground out in shaping the lens, a modification of the first test
serves well, as indeed it does for the general examination of large
discs. Instead of using a distant artificial star and a telescope,
one uses the lamp and screen, or even a candle flame ten feet or
more away and a condensing lens of rather short focus, which
may or may not be achromatic, so that the eye will get into its
focus conveniently while the lens is held in the hand. Fig. 42
shows the arrangement. Here <i>A</i> is the eye, <i>B</i> the condensing
lens, <i>C</i> the disc and <i>D</i> the source of light. The condensing lens
may be held on either side of the disc as convenience suggests,
and either disc or lens may be moved. The operation is substantially
the examination of a large disc piecemeal, instead of all at
once by the use of a big objective or mirror.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_067.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 42.</span>—Locating Striæ in the Substance of a Disc.</div>
</div>

<p>Now when a stria has been noted mark its location as to the
surface, and, moving the eye a little, look for parallax of the fault
with respect to the surface mark. If it appears to shift try a
mark on the opposite surface in the same way. Comparison of
the two inspections will show about where the fault lies with
respect to the surfaces, and therefore what is the chance of working
it out. Sometimes a look edgewise of the disc will help in
the diagnosis.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span></p>

<p>Numerous barely detectable striæ are usually worse than one
or two conspicuous ones, for the latter frequently throw the light
they transmit so wide of the focus that it does not affect the image,
which could be greatly damaged by slight blurs of light that just
miss focus.</p>

<p>Given a disc that passes well the tests for striæ and the like
the next step is to examine the perfection of the annealing, which
in its larger aspect is revealed by an examination in polarized light.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_068.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 43.</span>—Testing a Disc in Polarized Light.
</div>
</div>

<p>For this purpose the disc is set up against a frame placed on
table or floor with a good exposure to skylight behind it, and
inclined about 35° from the vertical. Behind it is laid a flat
shiny surface to serve as polarizer. Black enamel cloth smoothly
laid, a glass plate backed with black paint, or even a smooth
board painted with asphalt paint will answer excellently. Then
holding a Nicol prism before the eye and looking perpendicular
to the face of the disc, rotate the prism on its axis. Fig. 43
shows the arrangement, <i>A</i> being the eye, <i>B</i> the Nicol, <i>C</i> the disc,
and <i>D</i> the polarizer behind it.</p>

<p>If annealing has left no strain the only effect of rotating the
Nicol will be to change the field from bright to dark and back
again as if the disc were not there. Generally a pattern in the
form of a somewhat hazy Maltese cross will appear, with its arms
crossing the disc, growing darker and lighter alternately as the
Nicol is turned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span></p>

<p>If the cross is strongly marked but symmetrical and well
centered the annealing is fair—better as the cross is fainter and
hazier—altogether bad if colors show plainly or if the cross is
decentered or distorted. The test is extremely sensitive, so that
holding a finger on the surface of the disc may produce local
strain that will show as a faint cloudy spot.</p>

<p>A disc free of striæ and noticeable annealing strains is usually,
but not invariably, good, for too frequent reheating in the moulding
or annealing process occasionally leaves the glass slightly
altered, the effect extending, at worst, to the crystallization or
devitrification to which reference has been made.</p>

<p>Given a good pair of discs the first step towards fashioning
them into an objective is roughing to the approximate form
desired. As a guide to the shaping of the necessary curves,
templets must be made from the designed curves of the objective
as precisely as possible. These are laid out by striking the
necessary radii with beam compass or pivoted wire and scribing
the curve on thin steel, brass, zinc or glass. The two last are
the easier to work since they break closely to form.</p>

<p>From these templets the roughing tools are turned up, commonly
from cast iron, and with these, supplied with carborundum
or even sand, and water, the discs, bearing against the revolving
tool, are ground to the general shape required. They are then
secured to a slowly revolving table, bearing edgewise against a
revolving grindstone, and ground truly circular and of the proper
final diameter.</p>

<p>At this point begins the really careful work of fine grinding,
which must bring the lens very close to its exact final shape.
Here again tools of cast iron, or sometimes brass, are used, very
precisely brought to shape according to the templets. They are
grooved on the face to facilitate the even distribution of the
abrasive, emery or fine carborundum, and the work is generally
done on a special grinding machine, which moves the tool over
the firmly supported disc in a complicated series of strokes
imitating more or less closely the strokes found to be most
effective in hand polishing.</p>

<p>In general terms the operator in handwork at this task supports
the disc on a firm vertical post, by cementing it to a suitable
holder, and then moves the tool over it in a series of straight or
oval strokes, meanwhile walking around the post. A skilful
operator watches the progress of his work, varies the length and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
position of his strokes accordingly, and, despite the unavoidable
wear on the tool, can both keep its figure true and impart a
true figure to the glass.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_070.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 44.</span>—Dr. Draper’s Polishing Machine.</div>
</div>

<p>The polishing machine, of which a type used by Dr. Draper is
shown in Fig. 44, produces a similar motion, the disc slowly
revolving and the rather small tool moving over it in oval strokes
kept off the center. More often the tool is of approximately the
same diameter as the disc under it. The general character of
the motion is evident from the construction. The disc <i>a</i> is
chucked by <i>c c′</i> on the bed, turned by the post <i>d</i> and worm wheel
<i>e</i>. This is operated from the pulleys, <i>i</i>, <i>g</i>, which drive through <i>k</i>,
the crank <i>m</i>, adjustable in throw by the nuts <i>n</i>, <i>n′</i>, and in position
of tool by the clamps <i>r</i>, <i>r</i>. The motion may be considerably
varied by adjustment of the machine, always keeping the stroke
from repeating on the same part of the disc, by making the period
of the revolution and of the stroke incommensurable so far as
may be. Even in spectacle grinding machines the stroke may
repeat only once in hundreds of times, and even this frequency
in a big objective would, if followed in the polishing, leave tool
marks which could be detected in the final testing.</p>

<p>In the fine grinding, especially near the end of the process, the
templets do not give sufficient precision in testing the curves, and
recourse is had to the spherometer, by which measurements
down to about 1/100000 inch can be consistently made.</p>

<p>The next stage of operations is polishing, which transforms the
grey translucency of the fine ground lens into the clear and
brilliant surface which at last permits rigorous optical tests to be
used for the final finish of the lens. This polishing is done gen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>erally
on the fine grinding machine but with a very different tool
and with rouge of the utmost fineness.</p>

<p>The polishing tool is in any case ground true and is then faced
with a somewhat yielding material to carry the charge of rouge.
Cheap lenses are commonly worked on a cloth polisher, a texture
similar to billiard cloth being suitable, or sometimes on paper
worked dry.</p>

<p>With care either may produce a fairly good surface, with,
however, a tendency to polish out the minute hollows left by
grinding rather than to cut a true surface clear down to their
bottoms. Hence cloth or paper is likely to leave microscopic
inequalities apparently polished, and this may be sufficient to
scatter over the field a very perceptible amount of light which
should go to forming the image. All first class objectives and
mirrors are in fact polished on optician’s pitch. This is not the
ordinary pitch of commerce but a substance of various composition,
sometimes an asphaltic compound, again on a base of tar,
or of resin brought to the right consistency by turpentine.</p>

<p>Whatever the exact composition, the fundamental property
is that the material, apparently fairly hard and even brittle when
cold, is actually somewhat plastic to continued pressure. Sealing
wax has something of this quality, for a stick which may readily
be broken will yet bend under its own weight if supported at the
ends.</p>

<p>If the fine grinding process has been properly carried out the
lens has received its correct form as nearly as gauges and the
spherometer can determine it. The next step is to polish the surface
as brilliantly and evenly as possible. To this end advantage
is taken of the plastic quality already mentioned, that the glass
may form its own tool.</p>

<p>The base of the tool may be anything convenient, metal, glass
or even wood. Its working surface is made as nearly of the right
curvature as practicable and it is then coated with warm pitch
to a thickness of an eighth of an inch more or less, either continuously
or in squares, and while still slightly warm the tool is placed
against the fine ground disc, the exact shape of which it takes.</p>

<p>When cold the pitch surface can easily be cut out into squares
or symmetrically pitted with a suitable tool, at once facilitating
the distribution of the rouge and water that serves for polishing,
and permitting delicate adjustment of the working curvature in
a way about to be described.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span></p>

<p>Fig. 45 shows the squared surface of the tool as it would be
used for polishing a plane or very slightly convex or concave
surface. Supplied with the thin abrasive paste, it is allowed
to settle, cold, into its final contact with the glass, and then the
process of polishing by hand or machine is started.</p>

<p>The action of the tool must be uniform to avoid changing
the shape of the lens. It can be regulated as it was in the grinding,
by varying the length and character of the stroke, but even
more delicately by varying the extent of surface covered by the
pitch actually working on the glass.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i_072a.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 45.</span>—Tool for Flat Surface.
</div>
</div>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/i_072b.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 46.</span>—Tool for Concave Surface.</div>
</div>
<p>This is done by channeling or boring away pitch near the rim
or center of the tool as the case may be. Fig. 46 shows a
tool which has been thus treated so that the squares are progressively
smaller near the periphery. Such a spacing tends to
produce a concave surface from a flat tool or to increase the
concavity from a curved one. Trimming down the squares
towards the centre produces the opposite result.</p>

<p>Broadly, the principle is that the tool cuts the more in the
areas where the contact surfaces are the greater. This is not
wholly by reason of greater abrading surface, but also because
where the contact is greater in area the pitch settles less, from
the diminished pressure, thus increasing the effective contact.</p>

<p>Clearly the effect of trimming away is correlated with the
form and length of stroke, and the temper of the pitch, and in
fact it requires the wisdom of the serpent to combine these
various factors so as to produce the perfectly uniform and regular
action required in polishing. Now and then, at brief intervals,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
the operation is stopped to supply rouge and to avoid changing
the conditions by the heat of friction. Especially must heating
be looked out for in hand polishing of lenses which is often done
with the glass uppermost for easier inspection of the work.</p>

<p>Polishing, if the fine grinding has been judiciously done is,
for moderate sized surfaces, a matter of only a few hours. It
proceeds quite slowly at first while the hills are being ground down
and then rather suddenly comes up brilliantly as the polisher
reaches the bottoms of the valleys. Large lenses and mirrors may
require many days.</p>

<p>Now begins the final and extraordinarily delicate process of
figuring. The lens or mirror has its appointed form as nearly
as the most precise mechanical methods can tell—say down to one
or two hundred-thousandths of an inch. From the optical
standpoint the result may be thoroughly bad, for an error of a
few millionths of an inch may be serious in the final performance.</p>

<p>The periphery may be by such an amount longer or shorter in
radius than it should be, or there may be an intermediate zone
that has gone astray. In case of a mirror the original polishing is
generally intended to leave a spherical surface which must be converted
into a paraboloidal one by a change in curvature totalling
only a few hundred-thousandths of an inch and seriously affected
by much smaller variations.</p>

<p>The figuring is done in a fashion very similar to the polishing.
The first step is to find out by optical tests such as are described
in Chapter IX the location of the errors existing after the polishing,
and once found, they must be eliminated by patient and
cautious work on the surface.</p>

<p>Every optical expert has his own favorite methods of working
out the figure. If there is a hollow zone the whole surface must
be worked down to its level by repolishing; if, on the other hand,
there is an annular hump, one may repolish with stroke and tool-face
adapted to cut it down, or one may cautiously polish it out
until it merges with the general level.</p>

<p>Polishing is commonly done with tools of approximately the
size of the work, but in figuring there is great difference of practice,
some expert workers depending entirely on manipulation of a full
sized tool, others working locally with small polishers, even with
the ball of the thumb, in removing slight aberrations. In small
work where the glass can be depended on for homogeneity and
the tools are easily kept true the former method is the usual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
one, but in big objectives the latter is often easier and may
successfully reach faults otherwise very difficult to eliminate.</p>

<p>Among well known makers of telescopes the Clarks and their
equally skilled successors the Lundins, father and son, developed
the art of local retouching to a point little short of wizardry; the
late Dr. Brashear depended almost entirely on the adroitly
used polishing machine; Sir Howard Grubb uses local correction
in certain cases, and in general the cautiously modified polisher;
while some of the Continental experts are reported to have
developed the local method very thoroughly.</p>

<p>The truth probably is that the particular error in hand should
determine the method of attack and that its success depends
entirely on the skill of the operator. As to the perfection of the
objectives figured in either way, no systematic difference due to
the method of figuring can be detected by the most delicate tests.</p>

<p>In any case the figuring operation is long and tedious, especially
in large work where problems of supporting to avoid flexure arise,
where temperature effects on tool and glass involve long delays
between tests and correction, and where in the last resort non-spherical
surfaces must often be resorted to in bringing the image
to its final perfection.</p>

<p>The final test of goodness is performance, a clean round image
without a trace of spherical or zonal aberration and the color
correction the best the glasses will allow. Constant and rigorous
testing must be applied all through the process of figuring, and
the result seems to depend on a combination of experience, intuition
and tactual expertness rarely united in any one person.</p>

<p>Sir Howard Grubb, in a paper to be commended to anyone
interested in objectives, once forcibly said: “I may safely say
that I have never finished any objective over 10 inches diameter,
in the working of which I did not meet with some new experience,
some new set of conditions which I had not met before, and which
had then to be met by special and newly devised arrangements.”</p>

<p>The making of reflecting telescopes is not much easier since
although only one surface has to be worked, that one has to be
figured with extraordinary care, flexure has to be guarded against
at every stage of the working, and afterwards, temperature
change is a busy foe, while testing for correct figure, the surface
being non-spherical, is considerably more troublesome.</p>

<p>An expert can make a good mirror with far less actual labor
than an objective of similar aperture, but when one reads Dr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
Henry Draper’s statement that in spite of knowing at first hand
the methods and grinding machines of Lord Rosse and Mr. Lassell,
he ground over a hundred mirrors, and spent three years of time,
before he could get a correct figure with reasonable facility, one
certainly gains a high respect for the skill acquired.</p>

<p>This chapter is necessarily sketchy and not in the least intended
to give the reader a complete account of technical glass manufacture,
far less of the intricate and almost incommunicable art
of making objectives and mirrors. It may however lead to a
better understanding of the difference between the optical
glass industry and the fabrication of commercial glass, and lead
the reader to a fuller realization of how fine a work of art is a
finished objective or mirror as compared with the crude efforts
of the early makers or the hasty bungling of too many of their
successors.</p>

<small>THE PROPERTIES OF OBJECTIVES AND MIRRORS</small></h2>


<p>The path of the rays through an ordinary telescope has been
shown in Fig. 5. In principle all the rays from a point in the
distant object should unite precisely in a corresponding point
in the image which is viewed by the eyepiece. Practically it
takes very careful design and construction of the objective to
make them meet in such orderly fashion even over an angular
space of a single degree, and the wider the view required the more
difficult the construction. We have spoken in the account of the
early workers of their struggles to avoid chromatic and spherical
aberrations, and it is chiefly these that still, in less measure,
worry their successors.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_076.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 47.—Chromatic Aberration of Convex Lens.</div>
</div>

<p>The first named is due to the fact that a prism does not bend
light of all colors equally, but spreads them out into a spectrum;
red refracted the least, violet the most. Since a lens may be
regarded as an assemblage of prisms, of small angle near the centre
and greater near the edge, it must on the whole and all over
bend the blue and violet rays to meet on the axis nearer the rear
surface than the corresponding red rays, as shown in Fig. 47.
Here the incident ray <i>a</i> is split up by the prismatic effect of the
lens, the red coming to a focus at <i>r</i>, the violet at <i>v</i>.</p>

<p>One can readily see this chromatic aberration by covering up
most of a common reading glass with his hand and looking through
the edge portion at a bright light, which will be spread out into
a colored band.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span></p>

<p>If the lens is concave the violet rays will still be the more
bent, but now outwards, as shown in Fig. 48. The incident ray
<i>a′</i> is split up and the violet is bent toward <i>v</i>, proceeding as if
coming straight from a virtual focus <i>v′</i> in front of the lens, and
nearer it than the corresponding red focus <i>r′</i>. Evidently if we
could combine a convex lens, bending the violet inward too much,
with a concave one, bending it outward too much, the two
opposite variations might compensate each other so that red and
violet would come to the same focus—which is the principle of
the achromatic objective.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_077.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 48.</span>—Chromatic Aberration of Concave Lens.</div>
</div>

<p>If the refractive powers of the lenses were exactly proportional
to their dispersive powers, as Newton erroneously thought, it is
evident that the concave lens would pitch all the rays outwards
to an amount which would annul both the chromatic variation
and the total refraction of the convex lens, leaving the pair
without power to bring anything to a focus. Fortunately flint
glass as compared with crown glass has nearly double the dispersion
between red and violet, and only about 20% greater
refractive power for the intermediate yellow ray.</p>

<p>Hence, the prismatic dispersive effect being proportional to
the total curvature of the lens, the chromatic aberration of a
crown glass lens will be cured by a concave flint lens of about half
the total curvature, and, the refractions being about as 5 to 6, of
⅗ the total power.</p>

<p>Since the “power” of any lens is the reciprocal of its focal
length, a crown glass convex lens of focal length 3, and a concave
flint lens of focal length 5 (negative) will form an approximately
achromatic combination. The power of the combination will be
the algebraic sum of the powers of the components so that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
focal length of the pair will be about 5/2 that of the crown lens
with which we started.</p>

<p>To be more precise the condition of achromatism is</p>

<p class="center">
Σρδn + Σρ′δn′ = 0<br />
</p>

<p>where ρ is the reciprocal of a radius and δn, or δn′, is the difference
in refractive index between the rays chosen to be brought to
exact focus together, as the red and the blue or violet.</p>

<p>This conventional equation simply states that the sum of the
reciprocals of the radii of the crown lens multiplied by the dispersion
of the crown, must equal the corresponding quantity for
the flint lens if the two total dispersions are to annul each other,
leaving the combination achromatic. Whatever glass is used
the power of a lens made of it is</p>

<p class="center">
P( = 1/<i>f</i>) = Σρ(n - 1)<br />
</p>

<p>so that it will be seen that, other things being equal, a glass of
high index of refraction tends to give moderate curves in an objective.
Also, referring to the condition of achromatism, the greater
the difference in dispersion between the two glasses the less
curvatures will be required for a given focal length, a condition
advantageous for various reasons.</p>

<p>The determination of achromatism for any pair of glasses and
focal length is greatly facilitated by employing the auxiliary
quantity ν which is tabulated in all lists of optical glass as a
short cut to a somewhat less manageable algebraic expression.
Using this we can figure achromatism for unity focal length at
once,</p>


<p class="center">P = ν/(ν-ν′)<span class="i4">P′ = ν′/(ν-ν′)</span><span class="i4">ν = (n<sub><i>D</i></sub>-1)/δn</span></p>


<p>being the powers of the leading and following lenses respectively.
The combined lens will bring the rays of the two chosen colors, as
red and blue, to focus at the same point on the axis. It does not
necessarily give to the red and blue images of an object the same
exact size. Failure in this respect is known as chromatic difference
of magnification, but the fault is small and may generally be
neglected in telescope objectives.</p>

<p>We have now seen how an objective may be made achromatic
and of determinate focal length, but the solution is in terms of the
sums of the respective curvatures of the crown and flint lenses,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
and gives no information about the radii of the individual surfaces.
The relation between these is all-important in the final
performance.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a id="Fig_49"></a>
<img src="images/i_079a.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 49.</span>—Spherical Aberration of Convex Lens.</div>
</div>

<p>For in a convex lens with spherical surfaces the rays striking
near the edge, of whatever color, are pitched inwards too much
compared with rays striking the more moderate curvatures near
the axis, as shown in Fig. 49. The ray <i>a′ b′</i> thus comes to a focus
shorter than the ray <i>a b</i>.</p>

<p>This constitutes the fault of spherical aberration, which the old
astronomers, following the suggestions of Descartes, tried ineffectually
to cure by forming lenses with non-spherical surfaces.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_079b.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 50.</span>—Spherical Aberration of Concave Lens.</div>
</div>

<p>Fig. 50 suggests the remedy, for the outer ray <i>a″</i> is pitched out
toward <i>b″</i> as if it came from a focal point <i>c″</i>, while the ray nearer
the center <i>a″′</i> is much less bent toward <i>b″′</i> as if it came from <i>c″′</i>.
The spherical aberrations of a concave lens therefore, being opposite
to those of a convex lens, the two must, at least to a certain
extent, compensate each other as when combined in an
achromatic objective.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span></p>

<p>So in fact they do, and, if the curves that go to make up the
total curvatures of the two are properly chosen, the total spherical
aberration can be made negligibly small, at least on and near
the axis. Taking into account this condition, therefore, at once
gives us a clue to the distribution of the total curvatures and
hence to the radii of the two lenses. Spherical aberration,
however, involves not only the curvatures but the indices of
refraction, so that exact correction depends in part on the choice
of glasses wherewith to obtain achromatization.</p>

<p>In amount spherical aberration varies with the square of the
aperture and inversely with the cube of the focal length i.e.
with a²/f³. It is reckoned as + when, as in Fig. 49, the rim rays
come to the shorter focus, as-, when they come to the longer
focus.</p>

<p>In any event, since the spherical aberration of a lens may be
varied in above the ratio of 4:1, for the same total power, merely
by changing the ratio of the radii, it is evident that the two lenses
being fairly correct in total curvature might be given considerable
variations in curvature and still mutually annul the axial spherical
aberration.</p>

<p>Such is in fact the case, so that to get determinate forms for
the lenses one must introduce some further condition or make
some assumption that will pin down the separate curvatures to
some definite relations. The requirement
may be entirely arbitrary, but
in working out the theory of objectives
has usually been chosen to give
the lens some real or hypothetical
additional advantage.</p>

<p>The commonest arbitrary requirement
is that the crown glass lens
shall be equiconvex, merely to avoid
making an extra tool. This fixes one
pair of radii, and the flint lens is then given the required compensating
aberration choosing the easiest form to make. This
results in the objective of Fig. 51.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i_080.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap"> Fig. 51.</span>—Objectives with Equiconvex
Crown.</div>
</div>

<p>Probably nine tenths of all objectives are of this general form,
equiconvex crown and nearly or quite plano-concave flint. The
inside radii may be the same, in which case the lenses should be
cemented, or they may differ slightly in either direction as <i>a</i>, Fig. 51<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
with the front of the flint less curved than the rear of the crown,
and <i>b</i> where the flint has the sharper curve. The resulting
lens if ordinary glasses are chosen gives excellent correction of the
spherical aberration on the axis, but not much away from it,
yielding a rather narrow sharp field. Only a few exceptional
combinations of glasses relieve this situation materially.</p>

<p>The identity of the inner radii so that the surfaces can be
cemented is known historically as Clairault’s condition, and since
it fixes two curvatures at identity somewhat limits the choice of
glasses, while to get proper corrections demands quite wide
variations in the contact radii for comparatively small variations
in the optical constants of the glass.</p>

<p>When two adjacent curves are identical they should be
cemented, otherwise rays reflected from say the third surface of
Fig. 51 will be reflected again from the second surface, and passing
through the rear lens in almost the path of the original ray will
come to nearly the same focus, producing a troublesome “ghost.”
Hence the curvatures of the second and third surfaces when not
cemented are varied one way or the other by two or three per
cent, enough to throw the twice reflected rays far out of focus.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/i_081.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 52.</span>—Allied Forms of Cemented
Objectives.</div>
</div>

<p>In this case, as in most others, the analytical expression for the
fundamental curvature to be determined turns up in the form of
a quadratic equation, so that the
result takes the form a ± b and
there are two sets of radii that
meet the requirements. Of these
the one presenting the gentler
curves is ordinarily chosen. Fig.
52 <i>a</i> and <i>c</i> shows the two cemented
forms, thus related, for a common
pair of crown and flint
glasses, both cleanly corrected for chromatic and axial spherical
aberration.</p>

<p>Nearly a century ago Sir John Herschel proposed another
defining condition, that the spherical aberration should be removed
both for parallel incident rays and for those proceeding from a
nearer point on the axis, say ten or more times the focal length in
front of the objective. This condition had little practical value
in itself, and its chief merit was that it approximated one that
became of real importance if the second point were taken far
enough away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span></p>

<p>A little later Gauss suggested that the spherical aberration
should be annulled for two different colors, much as the chromatic
aberration is treated. And, being a mathematical wizard, he
succeeded in working out the very intricate theory, which resulted
in an objective approximately of the form shown in Fig. 53.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/i_082.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"> <span class="smcap">Fig. 53.</span>—Gaussian
Objective.</div>
</div>

<p>It does not give a wide field but is valuable for spectroscopic
work, where keen definition in all colors is essential.
Troublesome to compute, and difficult to
mount and center, the type has not been much
used, though there are fine examples of about
9&frac12; inches aperture at Princeton, Utrecht, and
Copenhagen, and a few smaller ones elsewhere,
chiefly for spectroscopic use.</p>

<p>It was Fraunhofer who found and applied
the determining condition of the highest practical
value for most purposes. This condition was absence of <i>coma</i>,
the comet shaped blur generally seen in the outer portions of a
wide field.</p>

<p>It is due to the fact that parallel oblique rays passing through
the opposite rims of the lens and through points near its center
do not commonly come to the same focus, and it practically
is akin to a spherical aberration for oblique rays which greatly
reduces the extent of the sharp field. It is reckoned + when
the blur points outwards,-when it points inwards, and is directly
proportional to the tangent of the obliquity and the square of the
aperture, and inversely to the square of the focal length i.e. it
varies with a²tan(u)/f².</p>

<p>Just how Fraunhofer solved the problem is quite unknown, but
solve it he did, and very completely, as he indicates in one of his
later papers in which he speaks of his objective as reducing all the
aberrations to a minimum, and as Seidel proved 30 years later in
the analysis of one of Fraunhofer’s objectives. Very probably
he worked by tracing axial and oblique rays through the objective
form by trigonometrical computation, thus finding his way to a
standard form for the glasses he used.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span></p>
<p>Fraunhofer’s objective, of which Fig. 54<i>a</i> is an example
worked by modern formulæ for the sine condition, gives very exact
corrections over a field of 2°-3° when the glasses are suitably
chosen and hence is invaluable for any work requiring a wide
angle of view.</p>

<p>With certain combinations of glasses the coma-free condition
may be combined successfully with Clairault’s,
although ordinarily the coma-free form falls
between the two forms clear of spherical aberration,
as in Fig. 52, <i>b</i>, which has its oblique
rays well compensated but retains serious axial
faults.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/i_083a.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 54.</span>—The Fraunhofer
Types.</div>
</div>

<p>Fraunhofer’s objective has for all advantageous
combinations of glasses the front
radius of the flint longer than the rear radius
of the crown hence the two must be separated
by spacers at the edge, which in small lenses in simple cells is
slightly inconvenient. However, the common attempt to simplify
mounting by making the front flint radius the shorter
almost invariably violates the sine condition and reduces the
sharp field, fortunately not a very serious matter for most astronomical
work.</p>

<p>The only material objection to the Fraunhofer type is the
strong curvature of the rear radius of the crown which gives a
form somewhat susceptible to flexure in large objectives. This is
met in the flint-ahead form, developed essentially by Steinheil,
and used in most of the objectives of his famous firm. Fig. 54<i>b</i>
shows the flint-ahead objective corresponding to
Fig. 54<i>a</i>. Obviously its curves are mechanically
rather resistant to flexure.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i_083b.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 55.</span>—Clark
Objective.</div>
</div>

<p>Mechanical considerations are not unimportant in
large objectives, and Fig. 55, a highly useful form
introduced by the Clarks and used in recent years
for all their big lenses, is a case in point. Here there
is an interval of about the proportion shown between
the crown and flint components.</p>

<p>This secures effective ventilation allowing the lenses to come
quickly to their steady temperature, and enables the inner<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
surfaces to be cleaned readily and freed of moisture. Optically
it lessens the deviation from the sine condition otherwise practically
inseparable from the equiconvex crown, reduces the
chromatic difference of spherical aberration, and gives an easy
way of controlling the color correction by slightly varying the
separation of the lenses.</p>

<p>One further special case is worth noting, that of annulling the
spherical aberration for rays passing through the lens in both
directions. By proper choice of glass and curvatures this can be
accomplished to a close approximation and the
resulting form is shown in Fig. 56. The front of the
crown is notably flat and the rear of the flint conspicuously
curved, the shape in fact being intermediate
between Figs. 52<i>b</i> and 52<i>c</i>. The type is
useful in reading telescopes and the like, and for
some spectroscopic applications.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i_084.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 56.</span>—Corrected in
Both Directions.</div>
</div>

<p>There are two well known forms of aberration not
yet considered; astigmatism and curvature of field.
The former is due to the fact that when the path of
the rays is away from the axis, as from an extended object,
those coming from a line radial to the axis, and those from a line
tangent to a circle about the axis, do not come to the same
focus. The net result is that the axial and tangential elements
are brought to focus in two coaxial surfaces touching at the axis
and departing more and more widely from each other as they
depart from it. Both surfaces have considerable curvature, that
for tangential lines being the sharper.</p>

<p>It is possible by suitable choice of glasses and their curvatures
to bring both image surfaces together into an approximate plane
for a moderate angular space about the axis without seriously
damaging the corrections for chromatic and spherical aberration.
To do this generally requires at least three lenses, and photographic
objectives thus designed (<i>anastigmats</i>) may give a substantially
flat field over a total angle of 50° to 60° with corrections
perfect from the ordinary photographic standpoint.</p>

<p>If one demands the rigorous precision of corrections called for
in astronomical work, the possible angle is very much reduced.
Few astrographic lenses cover more than a 10° or 15° field, and the
wider the relative aperture the harder it is to get an anastigmatically
flat field free of material errors. Astigmatism is rarely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
noticeable in ordinary telescopes, but is sometimes conspicuous in
eyepieces.</p>

<p>Curvature of field results from the tendency of oblique rays in
objectives, otherwise well corrected, to come to shorter focus
than axial rays, from their more considerable refraction resulting
from greatly increased angles of incidence. This applies to both
the astigmatic image surfaces, which are concave toward the
objective in all ordinary cases.</p>

<p>Fortunately both these faults are negligible near the axis.
They are both proportional to tan²{u}/f where u is the obliquity to
the axis and f the focal length; turn up with serious effect in wide
angled lenses such as are used in photography, but may generally
be forgotten in telescopes of the ordinary <i>F</i> ratios, like <i>F</i>/12 to
<i>F</i>/16. So also one may commonly forget a group of residual
aberrations of higher orders, but below about <i>F</i>/8 look out for
trouble. Objectives of wider aperture require a very careful
choice of special glasses or the sub-division of the curvatures
by the use of three or more lenses instead of two. Fig. 57
shows a cemented triplet of Steinheil’s design, with a crown lens
between two flints. Such triplets are made up to about 4 inches
diameter and of apertures ranging from <i>F</i>/4 to <i>F</i>/5.</p>

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 57.</span>—Steinheil Triple Objective.
&nbsp; &nbsp;  <span class="smcap">Fig. 58.</span>—Tolles Quadruple Objective.</div>
</div>

<p>In cases of demand for extreme relative aperture, objectives
composed of four cemented elements have now and then been
produced. An example is shown in Fig. 58, a four-part objective
of 1 inch aperture made by Tolles years ago for a small hand
telescope. Its performance, although it worked at <i>F</i>/4, was reported
to be excellent even up to 75 diameters.</p>

<p>The main difficulty with these objectives of high aperture is
the relatively great curvature of field due to short focal length
which prevents full utilization of the improved corrections off
the axis.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span></p>

<p>Distortion is similarly due to the fact that magnification is
not quite the same for rays passing at different distances
from the axis. It varies in general with the cube of the distance
from the axis, and is usually negligible save in photographic
telescopes, ordinary visual fields being too small to show it
conspicuously.</p>

<p>Distortion is most readily avoided by adopting the form of a
symmetrical doublet of at least four lenses as in common photographic
use. No simple achromatic pair gives a field wholly free
of distortion and also of the ordinary aberrations, except very
near the axis, and in measuring plates taken with such simple
objectives corrections for distortion are generally required.</p>

<p>At times it becomes necessary to depart somewhat from the
objective form which theoretically gives the least aberrations in
order to meet some specific requirement. Luckily
one may modify the ratios of the curves very perceptibly
without serious results. The aberrations
produced come on gradually and not by jumps.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i_086.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 59.</span>—“Bent”
Objective.</div>
</div>

<p>A case in point is that of the so-called “bent”
objective in which the curvatures are all changed
symmetrically, as if one had put his fingers on the
periphery and his thumbs on the centre of the whole
affair, and had sprung it noticeably one way or the
other.</p>

<p>The corrections in general are slightly deteriorated
but the field may be in effect materially flattened
and improved. An extreme case is the photographic
landscape lens. Figure 59 is an actual example from
a telescope where low power and very large angular
view were required. The objective was first designed
from carefully chosen glass to meet accurately the sine condition.
Even so the field, which covered an apparent angle of fully 40°,
fell off seriously at the edge.</p>

<p>Bearing in mind the rest of the system, the objective was
then “bent” into the form given by the dotted lines, and the
telescope then showed beautiful definition clear to the periphery
of the field, without any visible loss in the centre.</p>

<p>This spurious flattening cannot be pushed far without getting
into trouble for it does not cure the astigmatic difference of focus,
but it is sometimes very useful. Practically curvature of field is
an outstanding error that cannot be remedied in objectives re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>quired
to stand high magnifying powers, except by going to the
anastigmatic forms similar to those used in photography.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>Aside from curvature the chief residual error in objectives is
imperfection of achromatism. This arises from the fact that
crown and flint glasses do not disperse the various colors quite in
the same ratio. The crown gives slightly disproportionate
importance to the red end of the spectrum, the flint to the violet
end—the so-called “irrationality of dispersion.”</p>

<p>Hence if a pair of lenses match up accurately for two chosen
colors like those represented by the C and F lines, they will fail
of mutual compensation elsewhere. Figure 60 shows the situation.
Here the spectra from crown and flint glasses are brought
to exactly the same extent between the C and F lines, which
serve as landmarks.</p>

<p>Clearly if two prisms or lenses are thus adjusted to the same
refractions for C and F, the light passing through the combination
will still be slightly colored in virtue of the differences elsewhere
in the spectrum. These residual color differences produce
what is known as the “secondary spectrum.”</p>

<p>What this does in the case of an achromatic lens may be clearly
seen from the figure; C and F having exactly the same refractions
in the flint and crown, come to the same focus. For D, the yellow
line of sodium, the flint lens refracts a shade the less, hence is
not quite powerful enough to balance the crown, which therefore
brings D to a focus a little shorter than C and F. On the other
hand for A′ and G′, the flint refracts a bit more than the crown,
overbalances it and brings these red and violet rays to a focus
a little longer than the joint C and F focus.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_088.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 60.</span>—Irrationality of Dispersion.</div>
</div>

<p>The difference for D is quite small,
roughly about 1/2000 of the focal length,
while the red runs long by nearly three
times that amount, the violet by about
four. Towards the H line the difference
increases rapidly and in large telescopes
the actual range of focus for the various
colors amounts to several inches.</p>

<p>This difficulty cannot be avoided by
any choice among ordinary pairs of
glasses, which are nearly alike in the
matter of secondary spectrum. In the
latter part of the last century determined
efforts were made to produce glasses that
would give more nearly an equal run of
dispersion, at first by English experimenters,
and then with final success by
Schott and Abbé at Jena.</p>

<p>Both crown and flint had to be quite
abnormal in composition, especially the
latter, and the pair were of very nearly
the same refractive index and with small
difference in the quantity ν which we have
seen determines the general amount of
curvature. Moreover it proved to be
extremely hard to get the crown quite
homogeneous and it is listed by Schott
with the reservation that it is not free
from bubbles and striæ.</p>

<p>Nevertheless the new glasses reduce
the secondary spectrum greatly, to about
&frac14; of its ordinary value, in the average.
It is difficult to get rid of the spherical
aberration, however, from the sharp
curves required and the small difference
between the glasses, and it seems to be
impracticable on this account to go to
greater aperture than about <i>F</i>/20.</p>

<p>Figure 61 shows the deeply curved
form necessary even at half the relative
aperture usable with common glasses. At <i>F</i>/20 the secondary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
spectrum from the latter is not conspicuous and Roe (Pop. Ast.
<i>18</i>, 193), testing side by side a small Steinheil of the new glasses,
and a Clark of the old, of almost identical size and focal ratio,
found no difference in their practical performance.</p>

<p>Another attack on the same problem was more successfully
made by H. D. Taylor. Realizing the difficulty found with a
doublet objective of even the best matched of the new glasses, he
adopted the plan of getting a flint of exactly the right dispersion
by averaging the dispersions of a properly selected pair of flints
formed into lenses of the appropriate relative curvatures.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_089.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 61.</span>—Apochromatic Doublet.
&nbsp; &nbsp; <span class="smcap">Fig. 62.</span>—Apochromatic Triplet.</div>
</div>


<p>The resulting form of objective is made, especially, by Cooke of
York, and also by Continental makers, and carries the name of
“photo-visual” since the exactness of corrections is carried well
into the violet, so that one can see and photograph at the same
focus. The residual chromatic error is very small, not above 1/8
to 1/10 the ordinary secondary spectrum.</p>

<p>By this construction it is practicable to increase the aperture
to <i>F</i>/12 or <i>F</i>/10 while still retaining moderate curvatures and
reducing the residual spherical aberration. There are a round
dozen triplet forms possible, of which the best, adopted by Taylor,
is shown in Fig. 62. It has the duplex flint ahead—first a baryta
light flint, then a borosilicate flint, and to the rear a special light
crown. The two latter glasses have been under some suspicion
as to permanence, but the difficulty has of late years been reported
as remedied. Be that as it may, neither doublets nor triplets
with reduced secondary spectrum have come into any large<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
use for astronomical purposes. Their increased cost is considerable,<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>
their aperture even in the triplet, rather small for
astrophotography, and their achromatism is still lacking the
perfection reached by a mirror.</p>

<p>The matter of achromatism is further complicated by the fact
that objectives are usually over-achromatized to compensate for
the chromatic errors in the eyepiece, and especially in the eye.
As a general rule an outstanding error in any part of an optical
system can be more or less perfectly balanced by an opposite error
anywhere else in the system—the particular point chosen being a
matter of convenience with respect to other corrections.</p>

<p>The eye being quite uncorrected for color the image produced
even by a reflector is likely to show a colored fringe if at all bright,
the more conspicuous as the relative aperture of the pupil
increases. For low power eyepieces the emerging ray may quite
fill a wide pupil and then the chromatic error is troublesome.
Hence it has been the custom of skilled opticians, from the time
of Fraunhofer, who probably started the practice, to overdo the
correction of the objective just a little to balance the fault of
the eye.</p>

<p>What actually happens is shown in Fig. 63, which gives the
results of achromatization as practiced by some of the world’s
adepts. The shortest focus is in the yellow green, not far from
the line D. The longest is in the violet, and F, instead of coinciding
in focus with C as it is conventionally supposed to do,
actually coincides with the deep and faint red near the line marked
B. Hence the visible effect is to lengthen the focus for blue
enough to make up for the tendency of the eye in the other
direction. The resulting image then should show no conspicuous
rim of red or blue. The actual adjustment of the color correction
is almost wholly a matter of skilled judgment but Fig. 63
shows that of the great makers to be quite uniform. The smallest
overcorrection is found in the Grubb objective, the largest in the
Fraunhofer. The differences seem to be due mainly to individual
variations of opinion as to what diameter of pupil should be
taken as typical for the eye.</p>

<p>The common practice is to get the best possible adjustment for
a fairly high power, corresponding to a beam hardly 1/64 inch in
diameter entering the pupil.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span></p>

<p>In any case the bigger the pencil of rays utilized by the eye,
i.e., the lower the power, the more overcorrection must be provided,
so that telescopes intended, like comet seekers, for regular
use with low powers must be designed accordingly, either as
respects objective or ocular.</p>

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 63.</span>—Achromatization Curves by Various Makers.</div>
</div>

<p>The differences concerned in this chromatic correction for power
are by no means negligible in observing, and an objective actually
conforming to the C to F correction assumed in tables of optical
glass would produce a decidedly unpleasant impression when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
used with various powers on bright objects. And the values for
ν implied in the actual color correction are not immaterial in
computing the best form for a proposed objective.</p>

<p>1 is from Franunhofer’s own hands, the instrument of 9.6 inches
aperture and 170 inches focus in the Berlin Observatory.</p>

<p>2 The Clark refractor of the Lowell Observatory, 24 inches
aperture and 386 inches focal length. This is of the usual Clark
form, crown ahead, with lenses separated by about ⅙ of their
diameter.</p>

<p>3 is a Steinheil refractor at Potsdam of 5.3 inches aperture, and
85 inches focus.</p>

<p>4 is from the fine equatorial at Johns Hopkins University,
designed by Professor Hastings and executed by Brashear.</p>

<p>The objective was designed with special reference to minimizing
the spherical aberration not only for one chosen wave length
but for all others, has the flint lens ahead, aperture 9.4 inches,
focal length 142 inches, and the lenses separated by &frac14; inch in the
final adjustment of the corrections.</p>

<p>5 is from the Potsdam equatorial by Grubb, 8.5 inches aperture
124 inches focus.</p>

<p>The great similarity of the color curves is evident at a glance,
the differences due to variations in the glass being on the whole
much less significant than those resulting from the adjustment
for power.</p>

<p>Really very little can be done to the color correction without
going to the new special glasses, the use of which involves other
difficulties, and leaves the matter of adjustment for power quite
in the air, to be brought down by special eye pieces. Now and
then a melting of glass has a run of dispersion somewhat more
favorable than usual, but there is small chance of getting large
discs of special characteristics, and the maker has to take his
chance, minute differences in chromatic quality being far less
important than uniformity and good annealing.</p>

<p>Regarding the aberrations of mirrors something has been said
in Chap. I, but it may be well here to show the practical side
of the matter by a few simple illustrations.</p>

<p>Figure 64 shows the simplest form of concave mirror—a
spherical surface, in this instance of 90° aperture, the better to
show its properties. If light proceeded radially outward from <i>C</i>,
the center of curvature of the surface, evidently any ray would
strike the surface perpendicularly as at <i>a</i> and would be turned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
squarely back upon itself, passing again through the center of
curvature as indicated in the figure.</p>

<p>A ray, however, proceeding parallel to the axis and striking
the surface as at <i>bb</i> will be deflected by twice the angle of incidence
as is the case with all reflected rays. But this angle is
measured by the radius <i>Cb</i> from the center of curvature and the
reflected ray makes an angle <i>CbF</i> with the radius, equal to <i>FCb</i>.
For points very near the axis <i>bF</i>, therefore, equals <i>FC</i>, and substantially
also equals <i>cF</i>. Thus rays near the axis and parallel
to it meet at <i>F</i> the focus half, way from <i>c</i> to <i>C</i>. The equivalent
focal length of a spherical concave mirror of small aperture is
therefore half its radius of curvature.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_093.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 64.</span>—Reflection from Concave Spherical Mirror.</div>
</div>

<p>But obviously for large angles of incidence these convenient
equalities do not hold. As the upper half of the figure shows, the
ray parallel to the axis and incident on the mirror 45° away at <i>e</i>
is turned straight down, for it falls upon a surface inclined to it by
45° and is therefore deflected by 90°, cutting the axis far inside the
nominal focus, at <i>d</i>. Following up other rays nearer the axis it
appears that there is no longer a focal point but a cusp-like focal
surface, known to geometrical optics as a caustic and permitting
no well defined image.</p>

<p>A paraboloidal reflecting surface as in Fig. 65 has the property
of bringing to a single point focus all rays parallel to its axis while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
quite failing of uniting rays proceeding from any point on its
axis, since its curvature is changing all the way out from vertex to
periphery. Here the parallel rays <i>a</i>, <i>a</i>, <i>a</i>, <i>a</i> meeting the surface
are reflected to the focus <i>F</i>, while in a
perfectly symmetrical way the prolongation
of these rays <i>a′</i>, <i>a′</i>, <i>a′</i>, <i>a′</i> if incident on the
convex surface of the paraboloid would be
reflected in <i>R</i>, <i>R′</i>, <i>R″</i> <i>R″′</i> just as if they
proceeded from the same focus <i>F</i>.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i_094a.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 65.</span>—Reflection
from Paraboloid.</div>
</div>

<p>The difference between the spherical and
parabolic curves is well shown in Fig. 66.
Here are sections of the former, and in
dotted lines of the latter. The difference
points the moral. The parabola falls away
toward the periphery and hence pushes
outward the marginal rays. But it is of relatively sharper
curvature near the center and pulls in the central to meet the
marginal portion. In the actual construction of parabolic
mirrors one always starts with a sphere which is easy to test
for precision of figure at its center of curvature. Then the
surface may be modified into a paraboloid lessening the curvature
towards the periphery, or by increasing the curvature toward
the center starting in this case with a sphere of a bit longer radius
as in Fig. 66a.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_094b.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 66</span><i>a</i>. and
<span class="smcap">Fig. 66</span><i>b</i>.<br />
Variation of Paraboloid from Sphere.</div>
</div>

<p>Practice differs in this respect, either process leading to the
same result. In any case the departure from the spherical
curve is very slight—a few hundred thousandths or at most ten
thousandths of an inch depending on the size and relative focus
of the mirror.</p>

<p>Yet this small variation makes all the difference between
admirable and hopelessly bad definition. However the work is
done it is guided by frequent testing, until the performance shows
that a truly parabolic figure has been reached. Its attainment is
a matter of skilled judgment and experience.</p>

<p>The weak point of the parabolic mirror is in dealing with rays<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
coming in parallel but oblique to the axis. Figure 67 shows the
situation plainly enough. The reflected rays <i>a′</i>, <i>a″</i> no longer meet
in a point at the focus <i>F</i> but inside the focus for parallel rays, at <i>f</i>
forming a surface of aberration. The practical effect is that the
image rapidly deteriorates as the star passes away from the axis,
taking on an oval character that suggests a bad case of astigmatism
with serious complications from coma, which in fact is substantially
the case.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_095.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 67.</span>—Aberration of Parabolic Mirror.</div>
</div>

<p>Even when the angular aperture is very small the focal surface
is nevertheless a sphere of radius equal to one half the focal length,
and the aberrations off the axis increase approximately as the
square of the relative aperture, and directly as the angular
distance from the axis.</p>

<p>The even tolerably sharp field of the mirror is therefore
generally small, rarely over 30′ of arc as mirrors are customarily
proportioned. At the relative aperture usual with refractors, say
F/15, the sharp fields of the two are quite comparable in extent.
The most effective help for the usual aberrations<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> of the</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span></p>
<p>mirror is the adoption of the Cassegrain form, by all odds the
most convenient for large instruments, with a hyperboloidal
secondary mirror.</p>

<p>The hyperboloid is a curve of very interesting optical properties.
Just as a spherical mirror returns again rays proceeding from its
center of curvature without aberration, and the paraboloid sends
from its focus a parallel axial beam free of aberration, or returns
such a beam to an exact focus again, so a hyperboloid, Fig. 68,
sends out a divergent beam free from aberration or brings it,
returning, to an exact focus.</p>

<p>Such a beam <i>a</i>, <i>a</i>, <i>a</i>, in fact behaves as if it came from and
returned to a virtual conjugate focus <i>F′</i> on the other side of the
hyperbolic surface. And if the convex side be reflecting, converging
rays <i>R</i>, <i>R</i>′, <i>R″</i>, falling upon it at <i>P</i>, <i>P′</i>, <i>P″</i>, as if headed
for the virtual focus <i>F</i>, will actually
be reflected to <i>F′</i>, now a real focus.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i_096.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"> <span class="smcap">Fig. 68.</span>—Reflection from
Hyperboloid.</div>
</div>

<p>This surface being convex its aberrations
off the axis are of opposite
sign to those due to a concave surface,
and can in part at least, be made to
compensate the aberrations of a parabolic
main mirror. The rationale of
the operation appears from comparison
of Figs. 67 and 68.</p>

<p>In the former the oblique rays <i>a</i>,
<i>a′</i> are pitched too sharply down.
When reflected from the convex surface of Fig. 68 as a converging
beam along <i>R</i>, <i>R′</i>, <i>R″</i>, they can nevertheless, if the hyperbola be
properly proportioned, be brought down to focus at <i>F′</i> conjugate
to <i>F</i>, their approximate mutual point of convergence.</p>

<p>Evidently, however, this compensation cannot be complete over
a wide angle, when <i>F′</i> spreads into a surface, and the net result is
that while the total aberrations are materially reduced there is
some residual coma together with some increase of curvature of
field, and distortion. Here just as in the parabolizing of the large
speculum the construction is substantially empirical, guided in
the case of a skilled operator by a sort of insight derived from
experience.</p>

<p>Starting from a substantially spherical convexity of very
nearly the required curvature the figure is gradually modified
as in the earlier example until test with the truly parabolic mirror<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
shows a flawless image for the combination. The truth is that
no conic surface of revolution save the sphere can be ground to
true figure by any rigorous geometrical method. The result
must depend on the skill with which one by machine or hand
can gauge minute departures from the sphere.</p>

<p>Attempts have been made by the late Professor Schwarzchild
and others to improve the corrections of reflectors so as to increase
the field but they demand either very difficult curvatures imposed
on both mirrors, or the interposition of lenses, and have thus far
reached no practical result.</p>

<small>MOUNTINGS</small></h2>


<p>A steady and convenient mounting is just as necessary to the
successful use of the telescope as is a good objective. No satisfactory
observations for any purpose can be made with a telescope
unsteadily mounted and not provided with adjustments
enabling it to be moved smoothly and easily in following a
celestial object.</p>

<p>Broadly, telescope mounts may be divided into two general
classes, alt-azimuth and equatorial. The former class is, as its
name suggests, arranged to be turned in azimuth about a vertical
axis, and in altitude about a horizontal axis. Such a mounting
may be made of extreme simplicity, but obviously it requires two
motions in order to follow up any object in the field, for the
apparent motion of the heavenly bodies is in circles about the
celestial pole as an axis, and consequently inclined from the
vertical by the latitude of the place of observation.</p>

<p>Pointing a telescope with motions about a vertical and horizontal
axis only, therefore means that, as a star moves in its
apparent path, it will drift away from the telescope both in
azimuth and in altitude, and require to be followed by a double
motion.</p>

<p>Alt-azimuth mounts may be divided into three general groups
according to their construction. The first and simplest of them
is the pillar-and-claw stand shown in Figure 69. This consists
of a vertical pillar supported on a strong tripod, usually of brass
or iron, and provided at its top with a long conical bearing
carrying at its upper extremity a hinged joint, bearing a bar to
which the telescope is screwed as shown in the illustration.</p>

<p>If properly made the upper joint comprises a circular plate
carrying the bar and held between two cheek pieces with means
for taking up wear, and providing just enough friction to permit
of easy adjustment of the telescope, which can be swung in
altitude from near the zenith to the horizon or below, and turned
around its vertical axis in any direction.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span></p>

<p>When well made a stand of this kind is steady and smooth
working, readily capable of carrying a telescope up to about 3
inches aperture. It needs for its proper use a firm sub-support
for the three strong hinged legs of the pillar. This is conveniently
made as a very solid stool with spreading legs, or a plank of
sufficient size may be firmly bolted to a well set post.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_099.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 69.</span>—Table Mount with Slow Motion.</div>
</div>

<p>Thus arranged the mount is a very serviceable one for small
instruments. Its stability, however, depends on the base upon
which it is set. The writer once unwisely attempted to gain
convenience by removing the legs of the stand and screwing its
body firmly upon a very substantial tripod. The result was a
complete failure in steadiness, owing to the rather long lever arm
furnished by the height of the pillar; and the instrument, which
had been admirably steady originally, vibrated abominably
when touched for focussing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span></p>

<p>The particular stand here shown is furnished with a rack
motion in altitude which is a considerable convenience in following.
More rarely adjustable steadying rods attached to the
objective end of the instrument are brought down to its base,
but for a telescope large enough to require this a better mount is
generally desirable.</p>

<p>Now and then an alt-azimuth head of just the sort used in the
pillar-and-claw stand is actually fitted on a tall tripod, but such
an arrangement is usually found only in cheap instruments and
for such tripod mountings other fittings are desirable.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_100.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 70.</span>—Alt-azimuth Mount, Clark Type T.</div>
</div>

<p>The second form of alt-azimuth mount, is altogether of more
substantial construction. The vertical axis, usually tapered and
carefully ground in its bearings, carries an oblique fork in
which the telescope tube is carried on trunnions for its vertical
motion. The inclination of the forked head enables the telescope
to be pointed directly toward the zenith and the whole
mount forms the head of a well made tripod.</p>

<p>Figure 70 shows an excellent type of this form of mount as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
used for the Clark Type T telescope, designed for both terrestrial
and astronomical observation. In this particular arrangement
the telescope lies in an aluminum cradle carried on the trunnions,
from which it can be readily removed by loosening the thumb
screws and opening the cradle.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_101.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 71.</span>—Alt-azimuth with Full Slow Motions.</div>
</div>

<p>It can also be set longitudinally for balance in the cradle if any
attachments are to be placed upon either end. Here the adjustment
for the height of the instrument is provided both in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
spread of the tripod and in the adjustable legs. So mounted a
telescope of 3 or 4 inches aperture is easily handled and capable
of rendering very good service either for terrestrial or celestial
work.</p>

<p>Indeed the Clarks have made instruments up to 6 inches
aperture, mounted for special service in this simple manner.
For celestial use where fairly high powers may be required this
or any similar mount can be readily furnished with slow motions
either in azimuth or altitude or both.</p>

<p>Figure 71 shows a 4&frac14; inch telescope and mount by Zeiss thus
equipped. Some alt-azimuth mounts are also provided with a
vertical rack motion to bring the telescope to a convenient height
without disturbing the tripod. A good alt-azimuth mount such
as is shown in Figs. 70 and 71 is by no means to be despised
for use with telescopes of 3 or 4 inch aperture.</p>

<p>The sole inconvenience to be considered is that of the two
motions required in following. With well fitted slow motions
this is not really serious for ordinary observing with moderate
powers, for one can work very comfortably up to powers of
150 or 200 diameters keeping the object easily in view; but with
the higher powers in which the field is very small, only a few
minutes of arc, the double motion becomes rather a nuisance and
it is extremely inconvenient even with low powers in sweeping
for an object the place of which is not exactly known.</p>

<p>There are in fact two distinct kinds of following necessary
in astronomical observations. First, the mere keeping of the
object somewhere in the field, and second, holding it somewhat
rigorously in position, as in making close observations of detail
or micrometrical measurements. When this finer following
is necessary the sooner one gets away from alt-azimuth mounts
the better.</p>

<p>Still another form of alt-azimuth mount is shown in Fig. 72
applied for a Newtonian reflector of 6 or 8 inches aperture.
Here the overhung fork carrying the tube on trunnions is supported
on a stout fixed tripod, to which it is pivoted at the front,
and it is provided at the rear with a firm bearing on a sector borne
by the tripod.</p>

<p>At the front a rod with sliding coarse, and screw fine, adjustment
provides the necessary motion in altitude. The whole fork
is swung about its pivot over the sector bearing by a cross screw
turned by a rod with a universal joint.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span></p>

<p>This mount strongly suggests the original one of Hadley, Fig.
16, and is most firm and serviceable. A reflector thus mounted is
remarkably convenient in that the eyepiece is always in a most
accessible position, the view always horizontal, and the adjustments
always within easy reach of the observer.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_103.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 72.</span>—Alt-azimuth Newtonian Reflector.</div>
</div>

<p>Whenever it is necessary to follow an object closely, as in
using a micrometer and some other auxiliaries, the alt-azimuth
mount is troublesome and some modification adjustable by a
single motion, preferably made automatic by clockwork, becomes
necessary.</p>

<p>The first step in this direction is a very simple one indeed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
Suppose one were to tilt the azimuth axis so that it pointed to the
celestial pole, about which all the stars appear to revolve. Then
evidently the telescope being once pointed, a star could be followed
merely by turning the tube about this tilted axis. Of
course one could not easily reach some objects near the pole
without, perhaps, fouling the mount, but in general the sky is
within reach and a single
motion follows the star, very
easily if the original mount
had a slow motion in azimuth.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i_104.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 73.</span>—Parallactic Mount for Reflector.</div>
</div>

<p>This is in fact the simplest
form of equatorial mount,
sometimes called parallactic.
Figure 73 shows the principle
applied to a small reflector.
An oblique block with its angle
adjusted to the co-latitude of
the place drops the vertical
axis into line with the pole,
and the major part of the celestial
vault is then within
easy reach.</p>

<p>It may be regarded as the
transition step from the alt-azimuth
to the true equatorial.
It is rarely used for
refractors, and the first attempt
at a real equatorial
mount was in fact made by
James Short F. R. S. in
mounting some of his small
Gregorians.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> As a matter of
record this is shown, from Short’s own paper before the Royal
Society in 1749, in Fig. 74.</p>

<p>A glance shows a stand apparently most complicated, but
closer examination discloses that it is merely an equatorial
on a table stand with a sweep in declination over a very wide arc,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
and quite complete arrangements for setting to the exact latitude
and azimuth. The particular instrument shown was of 4 inches
aperture and about 18 inches long and was one of several
produced by Short at about this epoch.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_105.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 74.</span>—Short’s Equatorial Mount.</div>
</div>

<p>In the instrument as shown there is first an azimuth circle
<i>A A</i> supported on a base <i>B B B B</i> having levelling screws in the
feet. Immediately under the azimuth circle is mounted a compass
needle for approximate orientation, and the circle is adjustable
by a tangent screw <i>C</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span></p>

<p>Carried by the azimuth circle on a bearing supported by four
pillars is a latitude circle <i>D D</i> for the adjustment of the polar
axis, with a slow motion screw <i>E</i>. The latitude circle carries a
right ascension circle <i>F F</i>, with a slow motion <i>G</i>, and this in turn
carries on four pillars the declination circle <i>H H</i>, and its axis
adjustable by the slow motion <i>K</i>.</p>

<p>To this declination circle is secured the Gregorian reflector
<i>L L</i> which serves as the observing telescope. All the circles are
provided with verniers as well as slow motions. And the
instrument is, so to speak, a universal one for all the purposes of
an equatorial, and when the polar axis is set vertical equally
adapted for use as a transit instrument, theodolite, azimuth
instrument, or level, since the circles are provided with suitable
levels.</p>

<p>This mount was really a very neat and complete piece of work
for the purpose intended, although scarcely suitable for mounting
any but a small instrument. A very similar construction was
used later by Ramsden for a small refractor.</p>

<p>It is obvious that the reach of the telescope when used as an
equatorial is somewhat limited in the mount just described.
In modern constructions the telescope is so mounted that it may
be turned readily to any part of the sky, although often the
polar axis must be swung through 180° in order to pass freely
from the extreme southern to the extreme northern heavens.</p>

<p>The two motions necessary are those in right ascension to
follow the heavenly bodies in their apparent course, and in
declination to reach an object at any particular angular distance
from the pole.</p>

<p>There are always provided adjustments in azimuth and for
latitude over at least a small arc, but these adjustments are
altogether rudimentary as compared with the wide sweep given
by Short.</p>

<p>The fundamental construction of the equatorial involves
two axes working at right angles positioned like a capital T.</p>

<p>The upright of the T is the polar axis, fitted to a sleeve and
bearing the cross of the T, which is hollow and provides the
bearing for the declination axis, which again carries at right
angles to itself the tube of the telescope.</p>

<p>When the sleeve which carries the upright of the T points to
the pole the telescope tube can evidently be swung to cover an
object at any altitude, and can then be turned on its polar axis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
so as to follow that object in its apparent diurnal motion. The
front fork of a bicycle set at the proper angle with a cross axis
replacing the handle bars has more than once done good service
in an emergency. Figure 75 shows in section a modern equatorial
mount for a medium sized telescope.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_107.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 75.</span>—Section of Modern Equatorial.</div>
</div>

<p>The mounting shown in Fig. 75, by Zeiss, is thoroughly typical
of recent practice in instruments of moderate size. The general
form of this equatorial comes straight down to us from Fraun<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>hofer’s
mounting of the Dorpat instrument. It consists essentially
of two axes crossed exactly at right angles.</p>

<p>P, the polar axis, is aligned exactly with the pole, and is supported
on a hollow iron pier provided at its top with the latitude
block L to which the bearings of P are bolted. D the declination
axis supports the telescope tube T.</p>

<p>The tube is counterpoised as regards the polar axis by the
weight a, and as regards the declination axis by the weights b b.
At A, the upper section of the pier can be set in exact azimuth
by adjusting screws, and at the base of the lower section the
screws at B. B. allow some adjustment in latitude. To such
mere rudiments are the azimuth and altitude circles of Short’s
mount reduced.</p>

<p>At the upper end of the polar axis is fitted the gear wheel g,
driven by a worm from the clockwork at C to follow the stars
in their course. At the lower end of the same axis is the hour
circle h, graduated for right ascension, and a hand wheel for
quick adjustment in R. A.</p>

<p>At d is the declination circle, which is read, and set, by the telescope
t with a right angled prism at its upper end, which saves
the observer from leaving the eye piece for small changes.</p>

<p>F is the usual finder, which should be applied to every telescope
of 3 inches aperture and above. It should be of low power, with
the largest practicable field, and has commonly an aperture &frac14; or
⅕ that of the main objective, big enough to pick up readily
objects to be examined and by its coarse cross wires to bring
them neatly into the field. At m and n are the clamping screws
for the right ascension and declination axes respectively, while
o and p control the respective tangent screws for fine adjustment
in R. A. and Dec. after the axes are clamped. This mount has
really all the mechanical refinements needed in much larger
instruments and represents the class of permanently mounted
telescopes used in a fixed observatory.</p>

<p>The ordinary small telescope is provided with a mount of
the same general type but much simpler and, since it is not in a
fixed observatory, has more liberal adjustments in azimuth and
altitude to provide for changes of location. Figure 76 shows in
some detail the admirable portable equatorial mounting used
by the Clarks for instruments up to about 5 or 6 inches aperture.</p>

<p>Five inches is practically the dividing line between portable
and fixed telescopes. In fact a 5 inch telescope of standard con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>struction
with equatorial mounting is actually too heavy for
practical portability on a tripod stand. The Clarks have turned
out really portable instruments of this aperture, of relatively
short focus and with aluminum tube fitted to the mounting
standard for a 4 inch telescope, but the ordinary 5 inch equipment
of the usual focal length deserves a permanent placement.</p>

<p>In this mount the short tapered polar axis P is socketed between
the cheeks A, and tightened in any required position by the hand
screws B. The stout declination axis D bears the telescope
and the counterweight C. Setting circles in R. A. and Dec., p
and d respectively, are carried on the two axes, and each axis
has a worm wheel and tangent screw operated by a universal
joint to give the necessary slow motion.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_109.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 76.</span>—Clark Adjustable Equatorial Mount.</div>
</div>

<p>The worm wheels carry their respective axes through friction
bearings and the counter poising is so exact that the instrument
can be quickly swung to any part of the sky and the slow motion
picked up on the instant. The wide sweep of the polar axis
allows immediate conversion into an alt-azimuth for terrestrial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
use, or adjustment for any latitude. A graduated latitude arc is
customarily engraved on one of the check pieces to facilitate
this adjustment.</p>

<p>Ordinarily portable equatorials on tripod mounts are not
provided with circles, and have only a single slow motion, that
in R. A. A declination circle, however, facilitates setting up
the instrument accurately and is convenient for locating an
object to be swept for in R. A. which must often be done if one
has not sidereal time at hand. In Fig. 76 a thumb screw underneath
the tripod head unclamps the mount so that it may be at
once adjusted in azimuth without shifting the tripod.</p>

<p>As a rule American stands for fixed equatorials have the clock
drive enclosed in the hollow pillar which carries the equatorial
head as shown in the reflector of Fig. 35, and in the Clark
mount for refractors of medium size shown in Fig. 77. Here a
neat quadrangular pillar carries an equatorial mounting in
principle very much like Fig. 76, but big enough to carry telescopes
of 8 to 10 inches aperture. It has universal adjustment in
latitude, so that it can be used in either hemisphere, the clock
and its driving weight are enclosed in the pillar and slow motions
are provided for finding in R. A. and Dec. The adjustment in
azimuth is made by moving the pillar on its base-plate, which is
bolted to the pier. The convenient connections for accurate
following and the powerful clock make the mount especially
good for photographic telescopes of moderate size and the whole
equipment is most convenient and workmanlike. It is worth
noting that the circles are provided with graduations that are
plain rather than minute, in accordance with modern practice.
In these days of celestial photography equatorials are seldom
used for determining positions except with the micrometer, and
graduated circles therefore, primarily used merely for finding,
should be, above all things, easy to read.</p>

<p>All portable mounts are merely simplifications of the observatory
type of Fig. 75, which, with the addition of various labor
saving devices is applied to nearly all large refractors and to many
reflectors as well.</p>

<p>There is a modified equatorial mount sometimes known as
the “English” equatorial in which the polar axis is long and
supported on two piers differing enough in height to give the
proper latitude angle, the declination axis being about midway
of the polar axis. A bit of the sky is cut off by the taller pier,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
and the type is not especially advantageous unless in supporting
a very heavy instrument, too heavy to be readily overhung in
the usual way.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_111.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 77.</span>—Universal Observatory Mount (Clark 9-inch).</div>
</div>

<p>In such case some form of the “English” mounting is very
important to securing freedom from flexure and thereby the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
perfection of driving in R. A. so important to photographic work.
The 72 inch Dominion Observatory reflector and the 100 inch
Hooker telescope at Mt. Wilson are thus mounted, the former
on a counterpoised declination axis crosswise the polar axis, the
original “English” type; the latter on trunnions within a long
closed fork which carries the polar bearings at its ends.</p>

<p>Figure 78 shows the latter instrument, of 100 inches clear aperture
and of 42 feet principal focal length, increased to 135 feet
when used as a Cassegrainian. It is the immense stability of this
mount that has enabled it to carry the long cross girder bearing
the interferometer recently used in measuring the diameters of
the stars. Note the mercury-flotation drum at each end of the
polar axis. The mirrors were figured by the skillful hands of
Mr. Ritchey.</p>

<img src="images/i_113.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 79.</span>—English Equatorial Mount (72-inch Dominion Observatory Telescope).</div>
</div>

<p>Figure 79 gives in outline the proportions and mounting of
the beautiful instrument in service at the Dominion Observatory,
near Victoria, B. C. The mirror and its auxiliaries were figured
by Brashear and the very elegant mounting was by Warner and
Swasey. The main mirror is of 30 feet principal focus. The 20
inch hyperboloidal mirror extends the focus as a Cassagrainian to
108 feet. The mechanical stability of these English mounts
for very large instruments has been amply demonstrated by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
this, as by the Hooker 100 inch reflector. They suffer less from
flexure than the Fraunhofer mount where great weights are to be
carried, although the latter is more convenient and generally
useful for instruments of moderate size. It is hard to say too
much of the mechanical skill that has made these two colossal
telescopes so completely successful as instruments of research.</p>

<img src="images/i_114.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 80.</span>—Astrographic Mount with Bent Pier.</div>
</div>

<p>The inconvenience of having to swing the telescope tube to
clear the pier at certain points in the R. A. following is often a
serious nuisance in photographic work requiring long exposures,
and may waste valuable time in visual work. Several recent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
forms of equatorial mount have therefore been devised to allow
the telescope complete freedom of revolution in R. A., swinging
clear of everything.</p>

<p>One such form is shown in Fig. 80 which is a standard astrographic
mount for a Brashear doublet and guiding telescope.
The pier is strongly overhung in the direction of the polar axis
far enough to allow the instrument to follow through for any
required period, even to resuming operations on another night
without a shift of working position.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_115.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 81.</span>—Open Fork Mounting.</div>
</div>

<p>Another form, even simpler and found to be extremely satisfactory
even for rather large instruments, is the open polar fork
mount. Here the polar axis of an ordinary form is continued by
a wide and stiff casting in the form of a fork within which the
tube is carried on substantial trunnions, giving it complete
freedom of motion.</p>

<p>The open fork mount in its simplest form, carrying a heliostat
mirror, is shown in Fig. 81. Here <i>A</i> is the fork, <i>B</i> the polar
axis, carried on an adjustable sector for variation in latitude, <i>C</i>
the declination axis carrying the mirror <i>D</i> in its cell, <i>E</i> the slow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
motion in declination, and <i>F</i> that in R. A. Both axes can be
unclamped for quick motion and the R. A. axis can readily be
driven by clock or electric motor.</p>

<p>The resemblance to the fully developed English equatorial
mount of Fig. 78 is obvious, but the present arrangement gives
entirely free swing to a short instrument, is conveniently adjustable,
and altogether workmanlike. It can easily carry a short
focus celestial camera up to 6 or 8 inches aperture or a reflector of
4 or 5 feet focal length.</p>

<p>In Fig. 173, Chap. X a pair of these same mounts are shown
at Harvard Observatory. The nearer one, carrying a celestial
camera, is exposed to view. It is provided with a slow motion
and clamp in declination, and with an electric drive in R. A.,
quickly unclamped for swinging the camera. It works very
smoothly, its weight is taken by a very simple self adjusting
thrust bearing at the lower end of the polar axis, and altogether
it is about the simplest and cheapest equatorial mount of first
class quality that can be devised for carrying instruments of
moderate length.</p>

<p>Several others are in use at the Harvard Observatory and very
similar ones of a larger growth carry the 24 inch Newtonian
reflector there used for stellar photography and the 16 inch
Metcalf photographic doublet.</p>

<p>In fact the open fork mount, which was developed by the late<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
Dr. Common, is very well suited to the mounting of big reflectors.
It was first adapted by him to his 3 ft. reflector and later used for
his two 5 ft. mirrors, and more recently for the 5 ft. instrument at
Mt. Wilson, and a good many others of recent make. Dr.
Common in order to secure the easiest possible motion in R. A.
devised the plan of floating most of the weight assumed by the
polar axis in mercury.</p>

<p>Figure 82 is, diagrammatically, this fork mount as worked out
by Ritchey for the 5′ Mt. Wilson reflector. Here A is the lattice
tube, B the polar axis, C the fork and D the hollow steel drum
which floats the axis in the mercury trough E. The great mirror
is here shown worked as a simple Newtonian of 25 ft. focal length.
As a matter of fact it is used much of the time as a Cassegranian.</p>

<p>To this end the upper section of tube carrying the oblique
mirror is removed and a shorter tube carrying any one of three
hyperboloidal mirrors is put in its place. Fig. 83 is the normal
arrangement for visual or photographic work on the long focus,
100 ft. The dotted lines show the path of the rays and it will be
noticed that the great mirror is not perforated as in the usual
Cassegrainian construction, but that the rays are brought out by
a diagonal flat.</p>

<p>Figure 84 is a similar arrangement used for stellar spectroscopy
with a small flat and an equivalent focus of 80 ft. In Fig.
85 a radically different scheme is carried out. The hyperboloidal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
mirror now used gives an equivalent focus of 150 ft., and the auxiliary
flat is arranged to turn on an axis parallel to the declination
axis so as to send the reflected beam down the hollow polar axis
into a spectrograph vault below the southern end of the axis.
Obviously one cannot work near the pole with this arrangement
but only through some 75° as indicated by the dotted lines. The
fork mount is not at all universal for reflectors, as has already been
seen, and Cassegrainian of moderate size are very commonly

<p>We now come to a group of mounts which have in common the
fundamental idea of a fixed eyepiece, and incidentally better
protection of the observer against the rigors of long winter nights
when the seeing may be at its best but the efficiency of the
observer is greatly diminished by discomfort. Some of the
arrangements are also of value in facilitating the use of long focus
objectives and mirrors and escaping the cost of the large domes
which otherwise would be required.</p>

<p>Perhaps the earliest example of the class is found in Caroline
Herschel’s comet seeker, shown in Fig. 86. This was a Newtonian
reflector of about 6 inches aperture mounted in a fashion
that is almost self explanatory. It was, like all Herschel’s
telescopes, an alt-azimuth but instead of being pivoted in altitude
about the mirror or the center of gravity of the whole tube, it
was pivoted on the eyepiece location and the tube was counterbalanced
as shown so that it could be very easily adjusted in
altitude while the whole frame turned in azimuth about a
vertical post.</p>

<p>Thus the observer could stand or sit at ease sweeping in a
vertical circle, and merely had to move around the post as the
azimuth was changed. The arrangement is not without advantages,
and was many years later adopted with modifications
of detail by Dr. J. W. Draper for the famous instrument with
which he advanced so notably the art of celestial photography.</p>

<p>The same fundamental idea of freeing the observer from continual
climbing about to reach the eyepiece has been carried out
in various equatorially mounted comet seekers. A very good
example of the type is a big comet seeker by Zeiss, shown in
Fig. 87. The fundamental principle is that the ocular is at the
intersection of the polar and declination axis, the telescope tube
being overhung well beyond the north end of the former and
counterbalanced on the latter. The observer can therefore sit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
in his swivel chair and without stirring from it sweep rapidly
over a very wide expanse of sky.</p>

<p>This particular instrument is probably the largest of regular
comet seekers, 8 inches in clear aperture and 52&frac12; inches focal
length with a triple objective to ensure the necessary corrections
in using so great a relative aperture. In
this figure 1 is the base with corrections
in altitude and azimuth, 2 the counterpoise
of the whole telescope on its base,
3 the polar axis and R. A. circle, 4 the
overhung declination axis and its circle,
5 the counterpoise in declination, 6 the
polar counterpoise, and 7 the main telescope
tube. The handwheel shown
merely operates the gear for revolving
the dome without leaving the observing
chair.</p>

<p>The next step beyond the eyepiece
fixed in general position is so to locate
it that the observer can be thoroughly
protected without including the optical
parts of the telescope in such wise as to
injure their performance.</p>

<p>One cannot successfully observe through an open window on
account of the air currents due to temperature differences, and
in an observatory dome, unheated as it is, must wait after the
shutter is opened until the temperature is fairly steadied.</p>

<p>Except for these comet seekers practically all of the class
make use of one or two auxiliary reflections to bring the image
into the required direction, and in general the field of possible
view is somewhat curtailed by the mounting. This is less of a
disadvantage than it would appear at first thought, for, to begin
with, observations within 20° of the horizon or thereabouts are
generally unsatisfactory, and the advantages of a stable and
convenient long focus instrument are so notable as for many
purposes quite to outweigh some loss of sky-space.</p>

<p>The simplest of the fixed eyepiece group is the polar telescope
of which the rudiments are well shown in Fig. 88, a mount
described by Sir Howard Grubb in 1880, and an example of which
was installed a little later in the Crawford Observatory in Cork.
Here the polar axis A is the main tube of the telescope, and in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
front of the objective B, is held in a fork the declination cradle
and mirror C, by which any object within a wide sweep of declination
can be brought into the field and held there by hand or
clockwork through rotating the polar tube.</p>

<p>Looked at from another slant it is a polar heliostat, of which the
telescope forms the driving axis in R. A. The whole mount was
a substantial casting on wheels which ran on a pair of rails.
For use the instrument was rolled to a specially arranged window
and through it until over its regular bearings on a pier just
outside.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_120.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 87.</span>—Mounting of Large Comet Seeker.</div>
</div>

<p>A few turns of the wheel D lowered it upon these, and the back
of the frame then closed the opening in the wall leaving the
instrument in the open, and the eye end inside the room. The
example first built was of only 4 inches aperture but proved its
case admirably as a most useful and convenient instrument.</p>

<p>This mount with various others of the fixed eyepiece class
may be regarded as derived from the horizontal photoheliographs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
used at the 1874 transit of Venus and subsequently at many
total solar eclipses. Given an equatorially mounted heliostat
like Fig. 81 and it is evident that the beam from it may be turned
into a horizontal telescope placed in the meridian, (or for that
matter in any convenient direction) and held there by rotation of
the mirror in R. A., but also in declination, save in the case
where the beam travels along the extension of the polar axis.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_121.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 88.</span>—Grubb’s Original Polar Telescope.</div>
</div>

<p>For the brief exposure periods originally needed and the slow
variation of the sun in declination this heliostatic telescope was
easily kept in adjustment. The original instruments were of
5 inches aperture and 40 ft. focal length, and the 7 inch heliostat
mirror was provided with ordinary equatorial clockwork. Set up
with the telescope pointing along the polar axis no continuous
variation in declination is needed and the clock drive holds the
field steadily, as in any other equatorial.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span></p>

<p>Figure 89 shows diagrammatically the 12 inch polar telescope
used for more than twenty years past at the Harvard Observatory.
The mount was designed by Mr. W. P. Gerrish of the Harvard
staff and contains many ingenious features. Unlike Fig. 88 this
is a fixed mount, with the eye-end comfortably housed in a room
on the second floor of the main observatory building, and the
lower bearing on a substantial pier to the southward.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_122.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 89.</span>—Diagram of Gerrish Polar Telescope.</div>
</div>

<p>In the figure, <i>A</i> is the eye end, <i>B</i> the main tube with the
objective at its lower end and prolonged by a fork supported by
the bearing <i>C</i> and <i>D</i> is the declination mirror sending the beam
upward. The whole is rotated in R. A. by an electric clock drive,
and all the necessary adjustments are made from the eye end.</p>

<p>A view of the exterior is shown in Fig. 90, with the mirror and
objective uncovered. The rocking arm at the objective end,
operated by a small winch beside the ocular, swings clear both
mirror and objective caps in a few seconds, and the telescope is
then ready for use. Its focal length is 16 ft. 10 inches and it gives
a sweep in declination of approximately 80°. It gives excellent
definition and has proved a most useful instrument.</p>

<p>A second polar telescope was set up at the Harvard Observatory
station in Mandeville, Jamaica, in the autumn of 1900.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
This was intended primarily for lunar photography and was
provided with a 12 inch objective of 135 ft. 4 inches focal length
and an 18 inch heliostat with electric clock drive.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_123.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 90.</span>—Gerrish Polar Telescope, Harvard Observatory.</div>
</div>

<p>Inasmuch as all instruments of this class necessarily rotate
the image as the mirror turns, the tail-piece of this telescope is
also mounted for rotation by a similar drive so that the image is
stationary on the plate both in position and orientation. As
Mandeville is in N. lat. 18° 01′ the telescope is conveniently near
the horizontal. The observatory of Yale University has a large
instrument of this class, of 50 feet focal length, with a 15-inch
photographic objective and a 10-inch visual guiding objective
working together from the same heliostat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span></p>

<p>Despite its simplicity and convenience the polar telescope
has an obvious defect in its very modest sweep in declination,
only to be increased by the use of an exceptionally large mirror.
It is not therefore remarkable that the first serious attempt at a
fixed eyepiece instrument for general use turned to a different
construction even at the cost of an additional reflection.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i_124.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 91.</span>—Diagram of Equatorial Coudé.</div>
</div>

<p>This was the <i>equatorial coudé</i> devised by M. Loewy of the
Paris Observatory in 1882. (Fig. 91.) In the diagram A is
the main tube which forms
the polar axis, and B the eye
end under shelter, with all
accessories at the observer’s
hand. But the tube is broken
by the box casing C containing
a mirror rigidly supported
at 45° to the axis of
the main tube and of the side
tube D, which is counterbalanced
and is in effect a hollow
declination axis carrying the
objective E at its outer end.</p>

<p>In lieu of the telescope tube
usually carried on this declination
axis we have the 45° mirror, F, turning in a sleeve concentric
with the objective, which, having a lateral aperture, virtually
gives the objectives a full sweep in declination, save as the upper
pier cuts it off. The whole instrument is clock driven in R. A.,
and has the usual circles and slow motions all handily manipulated
from the eye end.</p>

<p>The <i>equatorial coudé</i> is undeniably complicated and costly,
but as constructed by Henry Frères it actually performs admirably
even under severe tests, and has been several times duplicated
in French observatories. The first <i>coudé</i> erected was of
10&frac12; inches aperture and was soon followed by one of 23.6 inches
aperture and 59 ft. focus, which is the largest yet built.</p>

<p>Still another mounting suggestive of both the polar telescope
and the <i>coudé</i> is due to Sir Howard Grubb, Fig. 92. Here as in
the <i>coudé</i> the upper part of the polar axis, <i>A</i>, is the telescope tube
which leads into a solid casing <i>B</i>, about which a substantial
fork, <i>C</i>, is pivoted. This fork is the extension of the side tube <i>D</i>,
which carries the objective, and thus has free swing in declina<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>tion
through an angle limited by the roof of the observing room
above, and the proximity of the horizon below.</p>

<p>Its useful swing, as in the polar telescope, is limited by the
dimensions of the mirror <i>E</i>, which receives the cone of rays from
the objective and turns it up the polar tube to the eyepiece. This
mirror is geared to turn at half the rate of the tube <i>D</i> so that the
angle <i>D E A</i> is continually bisected.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_125.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 92.</span>—Grubb Modified Coudé.</div>
</div>

<p>In point of fact the sole gain in this construction is the reduction
in the size of mirror required, by reason of the diminished
size of the cone of rays when it reaches the mirror. The plan
has been very successfully worked out in the fine astrographic
telescope of the Cambridge Observatory of 12&frac12; inches aperture
and 19.3 ft. focal length.</p>

<p>As in the other instruments of this general class the adjustments
are all conveniently made from the eye end. The Cambridge
instrument has a triple photo-visual objective of the form
designed by Mr. H. D. Taylor and the side tube, when not in use,
is turned down to the horizontal and covered in by a low wheeled
housing carried on a track. The sky space covered is from 15°
above the pole to near the horizontal.</p>

<p>It is obvious that various polar and <i>coudé</i> forms of reflector are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
quite practicable and indeed one such arrangement is shown in
connection with the 60 inch Mt. Wilson reflector, but we are here
concerned only with the chief types of mounting which have
actually proved their usefulness. None of the arrangements
which require the use of additional large reflecting surfaces are
exempt from danger of impaired definition. Only superlatively
fine workmanship and skill in mounting can save them from distortion
and astigmatism due to flexure and warping of the mirrors,
and such troubles have not infrequently been encountered.</p>

<p>To a somewhat variant type belong several valuable constructions
which utilize in the auxiliary reflecting system the cœlostat
rather than the polar heliostat or its equivalent. The cœlostat
is simply a plane mirror mounted with its plane fixed in that of a
polar axis which rotates once in 48 hours, i.e., at half the apparent
rate of the stars.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_126.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 93.</span>—Diagram of Snow Horizontal Telescope.</div>
</div>
<p>A telescope pointed at such a mirror will hold the stars motionless
in its field as if the firmament were halted à la Joshua. But
if a change of view is wanted the telescope must be shifted in
altitude or azimuth or both. This is altogether inconvenient,
so that as a matter of practice a second plane mirror is used to
turn the steady beam from the cœlostat into any desired
direction.</p>

<p>By thus shifting the mirror instead of the telescope, the latter
can be permanently fixed in the most convenient location, at the
cost of some added expense and loss of light. Further, the image
does not rotate as in case of the polar heliostat, which is often an
advantage.</p>

<p>An admirable type of the fixed telescope thus constituted is
the Snow telescope at Mt. Wilson (Cont. from the Solar Obs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
#2, Hale). Fig. 93 from this paper shows the equipment in
plan and elevation. The topography of the mountain top made
it desirable to lay out the axis of the building 15° E. of N. and
sloping downward 5° toward the N.</p>

<p>At the right hand end of the figure is shown the cœlostat
pier, 29 ft. high at its S end. This pier carries the cœlostat mirror
proper, 30 inches in diameter, on rails <i>a a</i> accurately E. and W. to
allow for sliding the instrument so that its field may clear the
secondary mirror of 24 inches diameter which is on an alt-azimuth
fork mounting and also slides on rails <i>b b</i>.</p>

<p>The telescope here is a pair of parabolic mirrors each of 24 inches
aperture and of 60 ft. and 145 ft. focus respectively. The beam
from the secondary cœlostat mirror passes first through the
spectrographic laboratory shown to the left of the main pier, and
in through a long and narrow shelter house to one of these mirrors;
the one of longest focus on longitudinal focussing rails <i>e e</i>, the
other on similar rails <i>c c</i>, with provision for sliding sidewise at <i>d</i>
to clear the way for the longer beam.</p>

<p>The ocular end of this remarkable telescope is the spectrographic
laboratory where the beam can be turned into the
permanently mounted instruments, for the details of which the
original paper should be consulted. The purpose of this brief
description is merely to show the beautiful facility with which
a cœlostatic telescope may be adapted to astrophysical work.
Obviously an objective could be put in the cœlostat beam for any
purpose for which it might be desirable.</p>

<p>Such in fact is the arrangement of the tower telescopes at
the Mt. Wilson Observatory. In these instruments we have the
ordinary cœlostat arrangement turned on end for the sake of
getting the chief optical parts well above the ground where,
removed from the heated surface, the definition is generally
improved. To be sure the focus is at or near the ground level, but
the upward air currents cause much less disturbance than the
crosswise ones in the Snow telescope.</p>

<p>The head of the first tower telescope is shown in Fig. 94.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>
A is the cœlostat mirror proper 17 inches in diameter and 12
inches thick, B the secondary mirror 12&frac34; inches in the shorter
axis of the ellipse, 22&frac14; inches in the longer, and also 12 inches<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
thick. C is the 12 inch objective of 60 ft. focus, and D the focussing
gear worked by a steel ribbon from below.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_128.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 94.</span>—Head of 60-inch Tower Telescope.</div>
</div>

<p>This instrument being for solar research the mirrors are
arranged for convenient working with the sun fairly low on either
horizon where the definition is at its best, and can be shifted
accordingly, to the same end as in the Snow telescope. There
is also provision for shifting the objective laterally at a uniform<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
rate from below, to provide for the use of the apparatus as
spectro-heliograph.</p>

<p>The tower is of the windmill type and proved to be fairly
steady in spite of its height, high winds being rare on Mt. Wilson.
The great thickness of the mirrors in the effort to escape
distortion deserves notice. They actually proved to be too
thick to give thermal conductivity sufficient to prevent distortion.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_129.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 95.</span>—Porter’s Polar Reflector.</div>
</div>

<p>In the later 150′ tower telescope the mirrors are relatively less
thick, and a very interesting modification has been introduced
in the tower, in that it consists of a lattice member for member
within another exterior lattice, so that the open structure is
retained, while each member that supports the optical parts is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
shielded from the wind and sudden temperature change by its
corresponding outer sheath.</p>

<p>Still another form of mounting to give the observer access
to a fixed eyepiece under shelter is found in the ingenious polar
reflector by Mr. Russell W. Porter of which an example with main
mirror of 16 inches diameter and 15 ft. 6 inches focal length was
erected by him a few years ago. Fig. 95 is entirely descriptive
of the arrangement which from Mr. Porter’s account seems to
have worked extremely well. The chief difficulty encountered
was condensation of moisture on the mirrors, which in some
climates is very difficult to prevent.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_130.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 96.</span>—Diagram of Hartness Turret Telescope.</div>
</div>

<p>It is interesting to note that Mr. Porter’s first plan was to use
the instrument as a Herschelian with its focus thrown below the
siderostat at <i>F′</i>, but the tilting of the mirror, which was worked
at F/11.6, produced excessive astigmatism of the images, and the
plan was abandoned in favor of the Newtonian form shown in
the figure. At F/25 or thereabouts the earlier scheme would
probably have succeeded well.</p>

<p>Still another fixed eyepiece telescope of daring and successful
design is the turret telescope of the Hon. J. E. Hartness of which
the inventor erected a fine example of 10 inch aperture at Springfield,
Vermont. The telescope is in this case a refractor, and the
feature of the mount is that the polar axis is expanded into a
turret within which the observer sits comfortably, looking into
the ocular which lies in the divided declination axis and is supplied
from a reflecting prism in the main beam from the objective</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span></p>

<p>Figure 96 shows a diagram of the mount and observatory.
Here <i>a</i> is the polar turret, <i>bb</i> the bearings of the declination
axis, <i>c</i> the main tube, d its support, and <i>e</i> the ocular end. Optically
the telescope is merely an ordinary refractor used with a
right angled prism a little larger and further up the tube than
usual. The turret is entered in this instance from below, through
a tunnel from the inventor’s residence. The telescope as shown
in Fig. 96 has a 10 inch Brashear objective of fine optical quality,
and the light is turned into the ocular tube by a right angled
prism only 2&frac34; inches in the face. This is an entirely practicable
size for a reflecting prism and the light lost is not materially
in excess of that lost in the ordinary “star diagonal” so necessary
for the observation of stars near the zenith in an ordinary equatorial.
The only obvious difficulty of the construction is the
support of the very large polar axis. Being an accomplished
mechanical engineer, Mr. Hartness worked out the details of
this design very successfully although the moving parts weighed
some 2 tons. The ocular is not absolutely fixed with reference
to the observer but is always conveniently placed, and the performance
of the instrument is reported as excellent in every
respect, while the sheltering of the observer from the rigors of
a Vermont winter is altogether admirable. Figure 97 shows the
complete observatory as it stands. Obviously the higher the
latitude the easier is this particular construction, which lends
itself readily to large instruments and has the additional advantage
of freeing the observer from the insect pests which are
extremely troublesome in warm weather over a large part of
the world.</p>

<p>This running account of mountings makes no claim at completeness.
It merely shows the devices in common use and some
which point the way to further progress. The main requirements
in a mount are steadiness, and smoothness of motion.
Even an alt-azimuth mount with its need of two motions, if
smooth working and steady, is preferable to a shaky and jerky
equatorial.</p>

<p>Remember that the Herschels did immortal work without
equatorial mountings, and used high powers at that. A clock
driven equatorial is a great convenience and practically indispensable
for the photographic work that makes so large a part of
modern astronomy, but for eye observations one gets on very
fairly without the clock.</p>

<p>Circles arc a necessity in all but the small telescopes used on
portable tripods, otherwise much time will be wasted in finding.
In any event do not skimp on the finder, which should be of
ample aperture and wide field, say &frac14; the aperture of the main<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
objective, and 3° to 5° in field. Superior definition is needless,
light, and sky room enough to locate objects quickly being the
fundamental requisites.</p>

<p>As a final word see that all the adjustments are within easy
reach from the eyepiece, since an object once lost from a high
power ocular often proves troublesome to locate again.</p>

<small>EYE PIECES</small></h2>


<p>The eyepiece of a telescope is merely an instrument for
magnifying the image produced by the objective or mirror. If
one looks through a telescope without its eyepiece, drawing the
eye back from the focus to its ordinary distance of distinct
vision, the image is clearly seen as if suspended in air, or it can be
received on a bit of ground glass.</p>

<p>It appears larger or smaller than the object seen by the naked
eye, in proportion as the focal length of the objective is larger
or smaller than the distance to which the eye has to drop back
to see the image clearly.</p>

<p>This real image, the quality of which depends on the
exactness of correction of the objective or mirror, is then to be
magnified so much as may be desirable, by the eyepiece of the
instrument. In broad terms, then, the eyepiece is a simple
microscope applied to the image of an object instead of the
object itself.</p>

<p>And looking at the matter in the simplest way the magnifying
power of any simple lens depends on the focal length of that lens
compared with the ordinary seeing distance of the eye. If this
be taken at 10 inches as it often conventionally is, then a lens of
1 inch focus brings clear vision down to an inch from the object,
increases the apparent angle covered by the object 10 times and
hence gives a magnifying power of 10.</p>

<p>But if the objective has a focal length of 100 inches the image,
as we have just seen, is already magnified 10 times as the naked
eye sees it, hence with an objective of 100 inches focus and a 1
inch eyepiece the total magnification is 100 diameters. And this
expresses the general law, for if we took the normal seeing distance
of the naked eye at some other value than 10 inches, say 12&frac12;
inches then we should have to reckon the image as magnified by
8 times so far as the objective inches is concerned, but 12&frac12;
times due to the 1 inch eyepiece, and so forth. Thus the
magnifying power of any eyepiece is F/f where F is the focal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
length of the objective or mirror and f that of the eyepiece.
The focal distance of the eye quite drops out of the reckoning.</p>

<p>All these facts appear very quickly if one explores the image
from an objective with a slip of ground glass and a pocket lens.
An ordinary camera tells the same story. A distant object which
covers 1° will cover on the ground glass 1° reckoned on a radius
equal to the focal length of the lens. If this is equal to the ordinary
distance of clear vision, an eye at the same distance will see
the image (or the distant object) covering the same 1°.</p>

<p>The geometry of the situation is as follows: Let <i>o</i> Fig. 5, Chap.
1, be the objective. This lens, as in an ordinary camera, forms an
inverted image of an object A B at its focus, as at <i>a b</i>, and for
any point, as <i>a</i>, of the image there is a corresponding point of the
object lying on the straight line from A to that point through the
center, <i>c</i>, of the objective.</p>

<p>A pair of rays 1, 2, diverging from the object point A pass
through rim and center of <i>o</i> respectively and meet in A. After
crossing at this point they fall on the eye lens <i>e</i>, and if <i>a</i> is nearly
in the principal focus of <i>e</i>, the rays 1 and 2 will emerge substantially
parallel so that the eye will unite them to form a clear
image.</p>

<p>Now if F is the focal length of <i>o</i>, and f that of <i>a</i>, the object
forming the image subtends at the center of the objective, o, an
angle <i>A c B</i>, and for a distant object this will be sensibly the angle
under which the eye sees the same object.</p>

<p>If L is the half linear dimension of the image, the eye sees half
the object covering the angle whose tangent is L/F. Similarly
half the image <i>ab</i> is seen through the eye lens <i>e</i> as covering a half
angle whose tangent is L/f. Since the magnifying power of the
combination, m, is directly as the ratio of increase in this tangent
of the visual angle, which measures the image dimension</p>

<p class="center">
m = F/f, as before
</p>

<p>Further, as all the light which comes in parallel through the
whole opening of the objective forms a single conical beam concentrating
into a focus and then diverging to enter the eye lens,
the diameter of the cone coming through the eye lens must bear
the same relation to the diameter of <i>o</i>, that f does to F.</p>

<p>Any less diameter of <i>e</i> will cut off part of the emerging light;
any more will show an emergent beam smaller than the eye lens,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
which is generally the case. Hence if we call p the diameter of
the bright pencil of light which we see coming through the eye
lens then for that particular eye lens,</p>

<p class="center">m = <i>o</i>/p</p>

<p>That is, f = pF/<i>o</i> which is quite the easiest way of measuring the
focal length of an eyepiece.</p>

<p>Point the telescope toward the clear sky, focusing for a distant
object so that the emergent pencil is sharply defined at the
ocular, and then measure its diameter by the help of a fine scale
and a pocket lens, taking care that scale and emergent pencil are
simultaneously in sharp focus and show no parallax as the eye is
shifted a bit. This bright circle of the emerging beam is actually
the projection by the eye lens of the focal image of the objective
aperture.</p>

<p>This method of measuring power is easy and rather accurate.
But it leads to trouble if the measured diameter of the objective
is in fact contracted by a stop anywhere along the path of the
beam, as occasionally happens. Examine the telescope carefully
with reference to this point before thus testing the power.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<p>The eye lens of Fig. 5 is a simple double convex one, such as
was used by Christopher Scheiner and his contemporaries.
With a first class objective or mirror the simple eye lens such
as is shown in Fig. 98a is by no means to be despised even now.
Sir William Herschel always preferred it for high powers, and
speaks with evident contempt of observers who sacrificed its
advantages to gain a bigger field of view. Let us try to fathom
the reason for his vigorously expressed opinion, strongly backed
up by experienced observers like the late T. W. Webb and Mr.
W. F. Denning.</p>

<p>First of all a single lens saves about 10% of the light. Each
surface of glass through which light passes transmits 95 to 96%
of that light, so that a single lens transmits approximately 90%,
two lenses 81% and so on. This loss may be enough to determine
the visibility of an object. Sir Wm. Herschel found that
faint objects invisible with the ordinary two lens eyepiece came
to view with the single lens.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span></p>

<p>Probably the actual loss is less serious than its effect on seeing
conditions. The loss is due substantially to reflection at the
surfaces, and the light thus reflected is scattered close to, or
into, the eye and produces stray light in the field which injures
the contrast by which faint objects become visible.</p>

<p>In some eyepieces the form of the surfaces is such that reflected
light is strongly concentrated where the eye sees it, forming
a “ghost” quite bright enough greatly to interfere with the vision
of delicate contrasts.</p>

<p>The single lens has a very small sharp field, hardly 10° in
angular extent, the image falling off rapidly in quality as it
departs from the axis. If plano-convex, as is the eye lens of
common two-lens oculars, it works best with the curved side to
the eye, i.e., reversed from its usual position, the spherical
aberration being much less in this position.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_137.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 98.</span>—Simple Oculars.</div>
</div>

<p>Herschel’s report of better definition with a single lens than
with an ordinary two lens ocular speaks ill for the quality of
the latter then available. Of course the single lens gives some
chromatic aberration, generally of small account with the narrow
pencils of light used in high powers.</p>

<p>A somewhat better form of eye lens occasionally used is the
so-called Coddington lens, really devised by Sir David Brewster.
This, Fig. 98b, is derived from a glass sphere with a thick equatorial
belt removed and a groove cut down centrally leaving a diameter
of less than half the radius of the sphere. The focus is, for ordinary
crown glass, 3/2 the radius of the sphere, and the field is a
little improved over the simple lens, but it falls off rather rapidly,
with considerable color toward the edge.</p>

<p>The obvious step toward fuller correction of the aberrations
while retaining the advantages of the simple lens is to make the
ocular achromatic, like a minute objective, thus correcting at
once the chromatic and spherical aberrations over a reasonably
large field. As the components are cemented the loss of light at
their common surface is negligible. Figure 98c shows such a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
lens. If correctly designed it gives an admirably sharp field of
15° to 20°, colorless and with very little distortion, and is well
adapted for high powers.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_138a.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 99.</span>—Triple Cemented Oculars.</div>
</div>

<p>Still better results in field and orthoscopy can be attained
by going to a triple cemented lens, similar to the objective of
Fig. 57. Triplets thus constituted are made abroad by Zeiss,
Steinheil and others, while in this country an admirable triplet
designed by Professor Hastings is made by Bausch &amp; Lomb.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_138.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 100.</span>—Path of Rays Through Huygenian Ocular.</div>
</div>

<p>Such lenses give a beautifully flat and sharp field over an angle
of 20° to 30°, quite colorless and orthoscopic. Fig. 99<i>a</i>, a form
used by Steinheil, is an excellent example of the construction
and a most useful ocular. The late R. B. Tolles made such
triplets, even down to ⅛ inch focus, which gave admirable
results.</p>

<p>A highly specialized form of triplet is the so-called monocentric
of Steinheil Fig. 99<i>b</i>. Its peculiarity is less in the fact
that all the curves are struck from the same center than in the
great thickness of the front flint and the crown, which, as in some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
photographic lenses, give added facilities for flattening the field
and eliminating distortion.</p>

<p>The monocentric eyepiece has a high reputation for keen
definition and is admirably achromatic and orthoscopic. The
sharp field is about 32°, rather the largest given by any of the
cemented combinations. All these optically single lenses are
quite free of ghosts, reduce scattered light to a minimum, and
leave little to be desired in precise definition. The weak point
of the whole tribe is the small field, which, despite Herschel’s
opinion, is a real disadvantage for certain kinds of work and
wastes the observer’s time unless his facilities for close setting
are more than usually good.</p>

<p>Hence the general use of oculars of the two lens types, all
of them giving relatively wide fields, some of them faultless also
in definition and orthoscopy. The earliest form, Fig. 100, is
the very useful and common one used by Huygens and bearing
his name, though perhaps independently devised by Campani of
Rome. Probably four out of five astronomical eyepieces belong
to this class.</p>

<p>The Huygenian ocular accomplishes two useful results—first,
it gives a wider sharp field than any single lens, and second
it compensates the chromatic aberration, which otherwise must
be removed by a composite lens. It usually consists of a plano-convex
lens, convex side toward the objective, which is brought
inside the objective focus and forms an image in the plane of a
rear diaphragm, and a similar eye lens of shorter focus by which
this image is examined.</p>

<p>Fig. 100 shows the course of the rays—<i>A</i> being the field lens,
<i>B</i> the diaphragm and <i>C</i> the eye lens. Let <i>1</i>, <i>2</i>, be rays which are
incident near the margin of <i>A</i>. Each, in passing through
the lens, is dispersed, the blue being more refracted than the
red. Both rays come to a general focus at <i>B</i>, and, crossing,
diverge slightly towards <i>C</i>.</p>

<p>But, on reaching <i>C</i>, ray <i>1</i>, that was nearer the margin and
the more refracted because in a zone of greater pitch, now falls on
<i>C</i> the nearer its center, and is less refracted than ray <i>2</i> which
strikes <i>C</i> nearer the rim. If the curvatures of <i>A</i> and <i>C</i> are
properly related <i>1</i> and <i>2</i> emerge from <i>C</i> parallel to each other
and thus unite in forming a distinct image.</p>

<p>Now follow through the two branches of <i>l</i> marked <i>l_r</i>, and <i>l_v</i>,
the red and violet components. Ray <i>l_v</i>, the more refrangible,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
strikes <i>C</i> nearer the center, and is the less refracted, emerging
from <i>C</i> substantially parallel with its mate <i>l_r</i>, hence blending
the red and violet images, if, being of the same glass, <i>A</i> and <i>C</i>
have suitably related focal lengths and separation.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact the condition for this chromatic compensation
is</p>

<p class="center">d = (f + f′)/2</p>

<p>where d is the distance between the lenses and f, f′, their respective
focal lengths. If this condition of achromatism be combined
with that of equal refraction at <i>A</i> and <i>C</i>, favorable to minimizing
the spherical aberration, we find f = 3f′ and d = 2f′. This is
the conventional Huygenian ocular with an eye lens ⅓ the focus
of the field lens, spaced at double the focus of the eye lens, with
the diaphragm midway.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i_140.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 101</span><i>a</i>.—Airy and
Mittenzuey Oculars.</div>
</div>

<p>In practice the ratio of foci varies from 1:3 to 1:2 or even
1:1.5, the exact figure varying with the
amount of overcorrection in the objective
and under-correction in the eye that has to
be dealt with, while the value of d should
be adjusted by actual trial on the telescope
to obtain the best color correction practicable.
One cannot use any chance ocular
and expect the finest results.</p>

<p>The Huygenian eyepieces are often referred to as “negative”
inasmuch as they cannot be used directly as magnifiers, although
dealing effectively with an image rather than an object. The
statement is also often made that they cannot be used with
cross wires. This is incorrect, for while there is noticeable distortion
toward the edge of the wide field, to say nothing of astigmatism,
in and near the center of the field the situation is a
good deal better.</p>

<p>Central cross wires in the plane of the diaphragm are entirely
suitable for alignment of the instrument, and over a moderate
extent of field the distortion is so small that a micrometer scale
in the plane of the diaphragm gives very good approximate
measurements, and indeed is widely used in microscopy.</p>

<p>It should be noted that the achromatism of this type of eyepiece
is compensatory rather than real. One cannot at the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
time bring the images of various colors to the same size, and also
to the same plane. As failure in the latter respect is comparatively
unimportant, the Huygenian eyepiece is adjusted so far
to compensate the paths of the various rays as to bring the
colored images to the same size, and in point of fact the result
is very good.</p>

<p>The field of the conventional form of Huygenian ocular is
fully 40°, and the definition, particularly centrally, is very
excellent. There are no perceptible ghosts produced, and while
some 10% of light is lost by reflection in the extra lens it is
diffused in the general field and is damaging only as it injures
the contrast of faint objects. The theory of the Huygenian eyepiece
was elaborately given by Littrow, (Memoirs R. A. S. Vol. 4,
p. 599), wherein the somewhat intricate geometry of the situation
is fully discussed.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/i_141.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 101</span><i>b</i>.—Airy
 and Mittenzwey Oculars.</div>
</div>

<p>Various modifications of the Huygenian type have been devised
and used. Figure 101<i>a</i> is the Airy form devised as a result of a
somewhat full mathematical investigation by
Sir George Airy, later Astronomer Royal.
Its peculiarity lies in the form of the lenses
which preserve the usual 3:1 ratio of focal
lengths. The field lens is a positive meniscus
with a noticeable amount of concavity in the
rear face while the eye lens is a “crossed”
lens, the outer curvature being about ⅙ of
the inner curvature. The marginal field in this ocular is a little
better than in the conventional Huygenian.</p>

<p>A commoner modification now-a-days is the Mittenzwey
form, Fig. 101<i>b</i>. This is usually made with 2:1 ratio of focal
lengths, and the field lens still a meniscus, but less conspicuously
concave than in the Airy form. The eye lens is the usual plano-convex.
It is widely used, especially abroad, and gives perhaps
as large available field as any ocular yet devised, approximately
50°, with pretty good definition out to the margin.</p>

<p>Finally, we come to the solid eyepiece Fig. 102<i>a</i>, devised by
the late R. B. Tolies nearly three quarters of a century ago, and
and often made by him both for telescopes and microscopes.
It is practically a Huygenian eyepiece made out of a single
cylinder of glass with a curvature ratio of 1&frac12;:1 between the eye
and the field lens. A groove is cut around the long lens at about
⅓ its length from the vertex of the field end. This serves as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
stop, reducing the diameter of the lens to about one-half its
focal length.</p>

<p>It is in fact a Huygenian eyepiece free from the loss of light
in the usual construction. It gives a wide field, more extensive
than in the ordinary form, with exquisite definition. It is really
a most admirable form of eyepiece which should be used far
more than is now the case. The late Dr. Brashear is on record
as believing that all negative eyepieces less than &frac34; inch focus
should be made in this form.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_142.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 102.</span>—Tolles’ Solid and Compensated Oculars.</div>
</div>

<p>So far as the writer can ascertain the only reason that it is not
more used is that it is somewhat more difficult to construct than
the two lens form, for its curvatures and length must be very
accurately adjusted. It is consequently unpopular with the constructing
optician in spite of its conspicuous merits. It gives no
ghosts, and the faint reflection at the eye end is widely spread so
that if the exterior of the cylinder is well blackened, as it should
be, it gives exceptional freedom from stray light. Still another
variety of the Huygenian ocular sometimes useful is analogous to
the compensating eyepiece used in microscopy. If, as commonly
is the case, a telescope objective is over-corrected for color to correct
for the chromatism of the eye in low powers, the high powers
show strong over correction, the blue focus being longer than the
red, and the blue image therefore the larger.</p>

<p>If now the field lens of the ocular be made of heavy flint glass
and the separation of the lenses suitably adjusted, the stronger
refraction of the field lens for the blue pulls up the blue focus and
brings its image to substantially the dimensions of the red, so
that the eye lens performs as if there were no overcorrection
of the objective.</p>

<p>The writer has experimented with an ocular of this sort as
shown in Fig. 102<i>b</i> and finds that the color correction is, as
might be expected, greatly improved over a Mittenzwey ocular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
of the same focus (⅕ inch). There would be material advantage
in thus varying the ocular color correction to suit the power.</p>

<p>In the Huyghenian eyepiece the equivalent focal length F is
given by,</p>

<p class="center">F = 2ff′/(f + f′)</p>

<p>where f and f′ are the focal lengths of the field and eye lenses
respectively. This assumes the normal spacing, d, of half the
sum of the focal lengths, not always adhered to by constructors.
The perfectly general case, as for any two combined lenses is,</p>

<p class="center">F = ff<sub>1</sub>/(f + f<sub>1</sub>-d)</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_143.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 103.</span>—Path of Rays Through Ramsden Ocular.</div>
</div>

<p>To obtain a flatter field, and particularly one free from distortion
the construction devised by Ramsden is commonly used.
This consists, Fig. 103, of two plano convex lenses of equal focal
length, placed with their plane faces outward, at a distance equal
to, or somewhat less than, their common focal length. The
former spacing is the one which gives the best achromatic compensation
since as before the condition for achromatism is</p>

<p class="center">d = &frac12;(f + f′)</p>

<p>When thus spaced the plane surface of the field lens is exactly
in the focus of the eye lens, the combined focus F is the same as
that of either lens, since as just shown in any additive combination
of two lenses</p>

<p class="center">F = ff′/(f + f′-d)</p>

<p>and while the field is flat and colorless, every speck of dust on the
field lens is offensively in view.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span></p>

<p>It is therefore usual to make this ocular in the form suggested
by Airy, in which something of the achromatic correction
is sacrificed to obviate this difficulty, and to obtain a better
balance of the residual aberrations. The path of the rays is
shown in Fig. 103. The lenses <i>A</i> and <i>B</i> are of the same focal
length but are now spaced at ⅔ of this length apart.</p>

<p>The two neighboring rays <i>1</i>, <i>2</i>, coming through the objective
from the distant object meet at the objective focus in a point, <i>a</i>,
of the image plane <i>a b</i>. Thence, diverging, they are so refracted
by <i>A</i> and <i>B</i> as to leave the latter substantially parallel so that
both appear to proceed from the point c, of the image plane <i>c</i>, <i>d</i>,
in the principal focus of <i>B</i>.</p>

<p>From the ordinary equation for the combination, F = &frac34; f.
The combination focusses &frac14; f back of the principal focus of the
objective, and the position of the eye is &frac14; F back of the eye
lens, which is another reason for shortening the lens spacing.
At longer spacing the eye distance is inconveniently reduced.</p>

<p>Thus constituted, the Ramsden ocular, known as “positive”
from its capability for use as a magnifier of actual objects, gives
a good flat field free from distortion over a field of nearly 35° and
at some loss of definition a little more. It is the form most
commonly used for micrometer work.</p>

<p>In all optical instruments the aberrations increase as one
departs from the axis, so that angular field is rather a loose term
depending on the maximum aberrations that can be tolerated.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<p>Of the Ramsden ocular there are many modifications. Sometimes
f and f′ are made unequal or there is departure from the
simple plano-convex form. More often the lenses are made
achromatic, thus getting rid of the very perceptible color in the
simpler form and materially helping the definition. Figure 104<i>a</i>
shows such an achromatic ocular as made by Steinheil. The
general arrangement is as in the ordinary Ramsden, but the
sharp field is slightly enlarged, a good 36°, and the definition is
improved quite noticeably.</p>

<p>A somewhat analogous form, but considerably modified in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
detail, is the Kellner ocular, Fig. 104<i>b</i>. It was devised by an
optician of that name, of Wetzlar, who exploited it some three
quarters of a century since in a little brochure entitled “Das
orthoskopische Okular,” as notable a blast of “hot air” as ever
came from a modern publicity agent.</p>

<p>As made today the Kellner ocular consists of a field lens which
is commonly plano-convex, plano side out, but sometimes crossed
or even equiconvex, combined with a considerably smaller eye
lens which is an over-corrected achromatic. The focal length
of the field lens is approximately 7/4 F, that of the eye lens 4/3 F,
separated by about &frac34; F.</p>

<p>This ocular has its front focal plane very near the field lens,
sometimes even within its substance, and a rather short eye
distance, but it gives admirable definition and a usable field of
very great extent, colorless and orthoscopic to the edge. The
writer has one of 2⅝″ focus, with an achromatic triplet as eye
lens, which gives an admirable field of quite 50°.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_145.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 104.</span>—Achromatic and Kellner Oculars.</div>
</div>

<p>The Kellner is decidedly valuable as a wide field positive
ocular, but it has in common with the two just previously
described a sometimes unpleasant ghost of bright objects.
This arises from light reflected from the inner surface of the field
lens, and back again by the front surface to a focus. This focus
commonly lies not far back of the field lens and quite too near
to the focus of the eye lens for comfort. It should be watched
for in going after faint objects with oculars of the types noted.</p>

<p>A decidedly better form of positive ocular is the modern
orthoscopic as made by Steinheil and Zeiss, Fig. 105<i>a</i>. It
consists of a triple achromatic field lens, a dense flint between
two crowns, with a plano-convex eye lens of much shorter focus
(⅓ to &frac12;) almost in contact on its convex side.</p>

<p>The field triplet is heavily over-corrected for color, the front
focal plane is nearly &frac12; F ahead of the front vertex of the field
lens, and the eye distance is notably greater than in the Kellner.
The field is above 40°, beautifully flat, sharp, and orthoscopic,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
free of troublesome ghosts. On the whole the writer is inclined
to rate it as the best of two-lens oculars.</p>

<p>There should also here be mentioned a very useful long relief
ocular, often used for artillery sights, and shown in Fig. 105<i>b</i>.
It consists like Fig. 104<i>a</i>, of a pair of achromatic lenses, but they
are placed with the crowns almost in contact and are frequently
used with a simple plano convex field lens of much longer focus,
to render the combination more fully orthoscopic.</p>

<p>The field, especially with the field lens, is wide, quite 40° as
apparent angle for the whole instrument, and the eye distance is
roughly equal to the focal length. It is a form of ocular that
might be very advantageously used in finders, where one often
has to assume uncomfortable angles of view, and long relief is
valuable.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_146.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 105.</span>—Orthoscopic and Long Relief Oculars.</div>
</div>

<p>Whatever the apparent angular field of an ocular may be,
the real angular field of view is obtained by dividing the apparent
field by the magnifying power. Thus the author’s big Kellner,
just mentioned, gives a power of 20 with the objective for which
it was designed, hence a real field of 2&frac12;°, while a second, power
65, gives a real field of hardly 0°40′, the apparent field in this case
being a trifle over 40°. There is no escaping this relation, so that
high power always implies small field.</p>

<p>The limit of apparent field is due to increasing errors away
from the axis, strong curvature of the field, and particularly
astigmatism in the outer zones. The eye itself can take in only
about 40° so that more than this, while attainable, can only be
utilized by peering around the marginal field.</p>

<p>For low powers the usable field is helped out by the accommodation
of the eye, but in oculars of short focus the curvature
of field is the limiting factor. The radius of curvature of the
image is, in a single lens approximately 3/2 F, and in the common
two lens forms about &frac34; F.</p>

<p>In considering this matter Conrady has shown (M. N. <i>78</i>
445) that for a total field of 40° the sharpness of field fails at a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
focal length of about 1 inch for normal power of accommodation.
The best achromatic combinations reduce this limit to about
&frac12; inch.</p>

<p>At focal lengths below this the sharpest field is obtainable
only with reduced aperture. There is an interesting possibility
of building an anastigmatic ocular on the lines of the modern
photographic lens, which Conrady suggests, but the need of
wide field in high powers is hardly pressing enough to stimulate
research.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 106.</span>—Ordinary Terrestrial Ocular.</div>
</div>

<p>Finally we may pass to the very simple adjunct of most
small telescopes, the terrestrial ocular which inverts the image
and shows the landscape right side up. Whatever its exact
form it consists of an inverting system which erects the inverted
image produced by the objective alone, and an eyepiece for viewing
this erected image. In its common form it is composed of
four plano-convex lenses arranged as in Fig. 106. Here A and B
for the inverting pair and C and D a modified Huygenian ocular.
The image from the objective is formed in the front focus of AB
which is practically an inverted ocular, and the erected image is
formed in the usual way between C and D.</p>

<p>The apparent field is fairly good, about 35°, and while slightly
better corrections can be gained by using lenses of specially
adjusted curvatures, as Airy has shown, these are seldom applied.
The chief objection to this erecting system is its length, some ten
times its equivalent focus. Now and then to save light and gain
field, the erector is a single cemented combination and the ocular
like Fig. 99<i>a</i> or Fig. 102<i>a</i>. Fig. 107 shows a terrestrial eyepiece so
arranged, from an example by the late R. B. Tolles. When carefully
designed an apparent field of 40° or more can be secured,
with great brilliancy, and the length of the erecting system is
moderate.</p>

<p>Very much akin in principle is the eyepiece microscope, such
as is made by Zeiss to give variable power and a convenient
position of the eye in connection with filar micrometers, Fig. 108.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
It is provided with a focussing collar and its draw tube allows
varying power just as in case of an ordinary microscope. In fact
eyepiece microscopes have long been now and then used to
advantage for high powers. They are easier on the eye, and give
greater eye distance than the exceedingly small eye lenses of
short focus oculars, and using a solid eyepiece and single lens
objective lose no more light than an ordinary Huygenian ocular.
The erect resultant image is occasionally a convenience in
astronomical use.</p>

<p>Quite analogous to the eyepiece microscope is the so-called
“Davon” micro-telescope. Originally developed as an attachment
for the substage of a microscope to give large images
of objects at a little distance it has grown also into a separate
hand telescope, monocular or binocular, for general purposes.
The attachment thus developed is shown complete in Fig. 109.
D is merely a well corrected objective set in a mount provided
with ample stops. The image is viewed by an ordinary microscope
or special eyepiece microscope A, as the case may be,
furnished with rack focussing at A′ and assembled with the objective
by means of the carefully centered coupling C.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span></p>

<p>It furnishes a compact and powerful instrument, very suitable
for terrestrial or minor astronomical uses, like the Tolles’ short-focus
hand telescopes already mentioned. When properly
designed telescopes of this sort give nearly the field of prism
glasses, weigh much less and lose far less light for the same effective
power and aperture. They also have under fairly high
powers rather the advantage in the matter of definition, other
things being equal.</p>

<small>HAND TELESCOPES AND BINOCULARS</small></h2>


<p>The hand telescope finds comparatively little use in observing
celestial bodies. It is usually quite too small for any except
very limited applications, and cannot be given sufficient power
without being difficult to keep steady except by the aid of a
fixed mounting. Still, for certain work, especially the observation
of variable stars, it finds useful purpose if sufficiently
compact and of good light-gathering power.</p>

<p>There is most decidedly a limit to the magnifying power which
can be given to an instrument held in the hand without making
the outfit too unsteady to be serviceable. Anything beyond 8 to
10 diameters is highly troublesome, and requires a rudimentary
mount or at least steadying the hand against something in order
to observe with comfort.</p>

<p>The longer the instrument the more difficult it is to manage,
and the best results with hand telescopes are to be obtained with
short instruments of relatively large diameter and low power.
The ordinary field glass of Galilean type comes immediately
to mind and in fact the field glass is and has been much used. As
ordinarily constructed it is optically rather crude for astronomical
purposes. The objectives are rarely well figured or accurately
centered and a bright star usually appears as a wobbly flare
rather than a point.</p>

<p>Furthermore the field is generally small, and of quite uneven
illumination from centre to periphery, so that great caution has
to be exercised in judging the brightness of a star, according to its
position in the field. The lens diameter possible with a field
glass of ordinary construction is limited by the limited distance
between the eyes, which must be well centered on the eyepieces
to obtain clear vision.</p>

<p>The inter-pupillary distance is generally a scant 2&frac12; inches so
that the clear aperture of one of the objectives of a field glass is
rarely carried up to 2 inches. The best field glasses have each
objective a triple cemented lens, and the concave lenses also<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
triplets, the arrangement of parts being that shown in Fig. 110.
Glasses of this sort rarely have a magnifying power above 5.</p>

<p>In selecting a field glass with the idea of using it on the sky
try it on a bright star, real or artificial, and if the image with
careful focussing does not pull down to a pretty small and uniform
point take no further interest in the instrument.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_151.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 110.</span>—Optical Parts of Field Glass.</div>
</div>

<p>The advantage of a binocular instrument is popularly much
exaggerated. It gives a somewhat delusive appearance of
brilliancy and clearness which is psychological rather than
physical. During the late war a very careful research was made
at the instance of the United States Government to determine
the actual value of a binocular field glass against a monocular
one of exactly the same type, the latter being cheaper, lighter, and
in many respects much handier.</p>

<p>The difference found in point of actual seeing all sorts of objects
under varying conditions of illumination was so small as to be
practically negligible. An increase of less than 5 per cent in
magnifying power enabled one to see with the monocular instrument
everything that could be seen with the binocular, equally
well, and it is altogether probable that in the matter of seeing
fine detail the difference would be even less than in general use,
since it is not altogether easy to get the two sides of a binocular
working together efficiently or to keep them so afterwards.</p>

<p>There has been, therefore, a definite field for monocular hand
telescopes of good quality and moderate power and such are
manufactured by some of the best Continental makers. Such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
instruments have sometimes been shortened by building them on
the exact principle of the telephoto lens, which gives a relatively
large image with a short camera extension.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_152.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 111.</span>—Steinheil Shortened Telescope.</div>
</div>

<p>A much shortened telescope, as made by Steinheil for solar
photographic purposes, is shown in Fig. 111. This instrument
with a total length of about 2 feet and a clear aperture of 2⅜
inches gives a solar image of &frac12; inch diameter, corresponding to an
ordinary glass of more than double that total length. Quite the
same principle has been applied to terrestrial telescopes by the
same maker, giving again an equivalent focus of about double the
length of the whole instrument. This identical principle has
often been used in the so-called Barlow lens, a negative lens
placed between objective and eyepiece and giving increased
magnification with small increase of length; also photographic
enlargers of substantially similar function have found considerable
use.</p>

<p>A highly efficient hand telescope for astronomical purposes
might be constructed along this line, the great shortening of the
instrument making it possible to use somewhat higher powers
than the ordinary without too much loss of steadiness. There is
also constructed a binocular for strictly astronomical use consisting
of a pair of small hand comet-seekers.</p>

<p>One of these little instruments is shown in Fig. 112. It has
a clear diameter of objectives of 1⅜ inch, magnification of 5, and
a brilliant and even field of 7&frac12;° aperture. The objectives are
triplets like Fig. 57, already referred to, the oculars achromatic
doublets of the type of Fig. 104<i>a</i>.</p>

<p>With the exception of these specialized astronomical field
glasses the most useful and generally available hand instrument
is the prism glass now in very general use. It is based on reversal
of the image by internal total reflection in two prisms having
their reflecting surfaces perpendicular each to the other. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
rudiments of the process lie in the simple reversion prism shown
in diagram in Fig. 113.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/i_153a.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 112.</span>—Astronomical
Binocular.</div>
</div>

<p>This is nothing more nor less than a right angled glass prism
set with its hypothenuse face parallel and with its sides at 45° to
the optical axis of the instrument.
Rays falling upon one of its refracting
faces at an angle of 45° are refracted
upon the hypothenuse face, are there
totally reflected and emerge from the
second face of the prism parallel to
their original course.</p>

<p>Inspection of Fig. 113 shows that
an element like A B perpendicular to
the plane of the hypothenuse face is
inverted by the total reflection so that
it takes the position A′ B′. It is
equally clear that an element exactly
perpendicular to A B will be reflected
from the hypothenuse face flatwise
as it were, and will emerge without its ends being reversed so
that the net effect of this single reflection is to invert the image
without reversing it laterally at the same time.</p>

<p>On the other hand if a second prism be placed behind the
first, flat upon its side, with its hypothenuse face occupying a
plane exactly perpendicular to that of the first prism, the line
A′B′ will be refracted, totally reflected and refracted again out of
the prism without a second inversion, while a line perpendicular
to A′B′ will be refracted endwise on the hypothenuse face of
the second prism and will be
inverted as was the line A B
at the start.</p>

<img src="images/i_153b.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"> <span class="smcap">Fig. 113.</span>—Reversion Prism.</div>
</div>

<p>Consequently two prisms
thus placed will completely
invert the image, producing
exactly the same effect as the
ordinary inverting system Fig. 106. The simple reversion prism
is useful as furnishing a means, when placed over an eye lens, and
rotated, of revolving the image on itself, a procedure occasionally
convenient, especially in stellar photometry. The two prisms
together constitute a true inverting system and have been utilized
in that function, but they give a rather small angular field and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
have never come into a material amount of use. The exact
effect of this combination, known historically as Dove’s prisms,
is shown plainly in Fig. 114.</p>

<img src="images/i_154a.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 114.</span>—Dove’s Prisms.</div>
</div>

<p>The first actual prismatic inverting system was due to M.
Porro, who invented it about the middle of the last century, and
later brought it out commercially under the name of “Lunette à
Napoleon Troisiéme,” as a glass for military purposes.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_154b.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 115.</span>—Porro’s Prism System.</div>
</div>

<p>The prism system of this striking form of instrument is shown
in Fig. 115. It was composed of three right angle prisms <i>A</i>, <i>B</i>,
and <i>C</i>. <i>A</i> presented a cathetus face to the objective and <i>B</i> a
cathetus face to the ocular. Obviously a vertical element
brought in along <i>a</i> from the objective would be reflected at the
hypothenuse face <i>b</i>, to a position at right angles to the original
one, would enter the hypothenuse face of <i>C</i> and thence after
two reflections at <i>c</i> and <i>d</i> flatwise and without change of direction
would emerge, enter the lower cathetus face of <i>B</i> and by reflection
at the hypothenuse face <i>e</i> of <i>B</i> would be turned another
90° making a complete reversion as regards up and down at the
eye placed at <i>f</i>. An element initially at right angles to the one
just considered would enter <i>A</i>, be reflected flatwise, in the faces
of <i>C</i> be twice reflected endwise, thereby completely inverting it,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
and would again be reflected flatwise from the hypothenuse
face of <i>C</i>, thereby effecting, as the path of the rays indicated
plainly shows, a complete inversion of the image. Focussing was
very simply attained by a screw
motion affecting the prism <i>C</i> and
the whole affair was in a small
flat case, the external appearance
and size of which is indicated in
Fig. 116.</p>

Troisiéme.</div>
</div>

<p>From ocular to objective the
length was about an inch and a
half. It was of 10 power and took
in a field of 45 yards at a distance
of 1000 yards. Here for the first
time we find a prismatic inverting
system of strictly modern type.
And it is interesting to note that
if one had wished to make a
binocular “Lunette à Napoleon
Troisiéme” he would inevitably
have produced an instrument with
enhanced stereoscopic effect like
the modern prism field glass by the mere effort to dodge the
observer’s nose. Somewhat earlier M. Porro had arranged his
prisms in the present conventional form of Fig. 117, where two
right angle prisms have their faces positioned in parallel planes,
but turned around by 90° as in Fig. 114. The ray traced through
this conventional system shows that exactly the same inversion
occurs here as in the original Porro construction, and this form
is the one which has been most commonly used for prismatic
inversion and is conveniently known as Porro’s first form, it
actually having been antecedent in principle and practice to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
“Lunette à Napoleon Troisiéme.” The original published
description of Porro’s work, translated from “Cosmos” Vol. 2,
p. 222 (1852) et seq. is here annexed as it sets forth the origin
of the modern prism glass in unmistakable terms.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_155b.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 117.</span>—Porro’s First Form of Prisms.</div>
</div>

<p><i>Cosmos, Vol. 2</i>, p. 222.—“We have wished for some time to make
known to our readers the precious advantages of the “longue-vue
cornet” or télémetre of M. Porro. Ordinary spyglasses or terrestrial
telescopes of small dimensions are at least 30 or 40 cm.
long when extended to give distinct vision of distant objects.
The length is considerably reduced by substituting for a fixed
tube multiple tubes sliding into each other. But the drawing
out which this substitution necessitates is a somewhat grave
inconvenience; one cannot point the telescope without arranging
it and losing time.</p>

<p>For a long time we have wished it were possible to have the
power of viewing distant objects, with telescopes very short and
without draw. M. Porro’s “longue-vue cornet” seems to us to
solve completely this difficult and important problem. Its construction
rests upon an exceedingly ingenious artifice which literally
folds triply the axis of the telescope and the luminous ray so
that by this fact alone the length of the instrument is reduced by
two-thirds.</p>

<p>Let us try to give an idea of this construction: Behind the
telescope objective M. Porro places a rectangular isosceles
prism of which the hypothenuse is perpendicular to the optic
axis. The luminous rays from the object fall upon the rectangular
faces of this prism, are twice totally reflected, and return upon
themselves parallel to their original direction: half way to the
point where they would form the image of the object, they are
arrested by a second prism entirely similar to the first, which
returns them to their original direction and sends them to the
eyepiece through which we observe the real image. If the rectangular
faces of the second prism were parallel to the faces of the
first, this real image would be inverted—the telescope would be
an astronomical and not a terrestrial telescope. But M. Porro
being an optician eminently dextrous, well divined that to
effect the reinversion it sufficed to place the rectangular faces of
the second prism perpendicular to the corresponding faces of the
first by turning them a quarter revolution upon themselves.</p>

<p>In effect, a quarter revolution of a reflecting surface is a half
revolution for the image, and a half revolution of the image<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
evidently carries the bottom to the top and the right to the left,
effecting a complete inversion. As the image is thus <i>redressed</i>
independently of the eyepiece one can evidently view it with a
simple two-lens ocular which decreases still further the length
of the telescope so that it is finally reduced to about a quarter
of that of a telescope of equal magnifying power, field and
clearness.</p>

<p>The new telescope is then a true pocket telescope even with
a magnifying power of 10 or 15. Its dimensions in length and
bulk are those of a field glass usually magnifying only 4 to 6
times. The more draws, the more bother,—it here suffices to
turn a little thumbscrew to find in an instant the point of
sharpest vision.</p>

<p>In brilliancy necessarily cut down a little, not by the double
total reflection, which as is well known does not lose light, but
by the quadruple passage across the substance of the two prisms,
the cornet in sharpness and amplification of the images can
compare with the best hunting telescopes of the celebrated
optician Ploessl of Vienna. M. Porro has constructed upon the
same principles a marine telescope only 15 c.m. long with an
objective of 40 m.m. aperture which replaces an ordinary marine
glass 70 c.m. long. He has done still better,—a telescope only
30 c.m. long carries a 60 m.m. objective and can be made by turns
a day and a night glass, by substituting by a simple movement of
the hand and without dismounting anything, one ocular for the
other. Its brilliancy and magnification of a dozen times with
the night ocular, of twenty-five times with the day ocular,
permits observing without difficulty the eclipses of the satellites
of Jupiter.</p>

<p>This is evidently immense progress. One of the most illustrious
of German physicists, M. Dove of Berlin, gave in 1851 the
name of reversion prism to the combination of two prisms placed
normally one behind the other so that their corresponding faces
were perpendicular. He presented this disposition as an important
new discovery made by himself. He doubtless did not
know that M. Porro, who deserves all the honor of this charming
application, had realized it long before him.”</p>

<img src="images/i_158a.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 118.</span>—Porro’s
Second Form.</div>
</div>

<p>A little later M. Porro produced what is commonly referred to
as Porro’s second form, which is derived directly from annexing <i>A</i>
Fig. 115 to the corresponding half of <i>C</i> as a single prism, the
other half of <i>B</i> being similarly annexed to the prism <i>C</i>, thus form<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>ing
two sphenoid prisms, such as are shown in Fig. 118
which may be mounted separately or may have their faces
cemented together to save loss of light by
reflections. The sphenoid prisms have
had the reputation of being much more
difficult to construct than the plain right
angled prisms of the other forms shown.
In point of fact they are not particularly
difficult to make and the best inverting
eye pieces for telescopes are now constructed
with sphenoid prisms like those
just described.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_158b.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 119.</span>—Clark Prismatic Eyepiece.</div>
</div>

<p>This particular arrangement lends itself very readily to a fairly
compact and symmetrical mounting, as is well shown in Fig. 119
which is the terrestrial prismatic eyepiece as constructed by the
Alvan Clark corporation for application to various astronomical
telescopes of their manufacture. A glance at the cut shows the
compactness of the arrangement, which actually shortens the
linear distance between objective and ocular by the amount of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
the path of the ray through the prisms instead of lengthening the
distance as in the common terrestrial eyepiece.</p>

<p>The field moreover is much larger than that attainable by a
construction like Fig. 110, extending to something over 40°,
and there is no strong tendency for the illumination or definition
to fall off near the edge of the field.</p>

<p>In the practical construction of prism field glasses the two right
angled prisms are usually separated by a moderate space as in
Porro’s original instruments so as to shorten the actual length
of the prism telescope by folding the ray upon itself as in Fig. 120,
which is a typical modern binocular of this class.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_159a.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 120.</span>—Section of Prism Binocular.</div>
</div>

<p>The path of the rays is plainly shown and the manner in which
the prisms fold up the total focal length of the objective is quite
obvious. The added stereoscopic effect obtained by the arrangement
of the two sides of the instrument is practically a very
material gain. It gives admirable modelling of the visible field,
a perception of distance which is at least very noticeable and a
certain power of penetration, as through a mass of underbrush,
which results from the objectives to a certain extent seeing around
small objects so that one or the other of them gives an image of
something beyond. For near objects there is some exaggeration
of stereoscopic effect but on the whole for terrestrial use the net
gain is decidedly in evidence.</p>

<p>A well made prism binocular is an extremely useful instrument
for observation of the heavens, provided the objectives are of fair<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
size, and the prisms big enough to receive the whole beam from
the objective, and well executed enough to give a thoroughly
good image with a flat field.</p>

<p>The weak points of the prism glass are great loss of light
through reflection at the usual 10 air-glass surfaces and the
general presence of annoying ghosts of bright objects in the
field. Most such binoculars have Kellner eyepieces which are
peculiarly bad, as we have seen, with respect to reflected images,
and present the plane surface of the last prism to the plane
front of the field lens. Recently some constructors have utilized
the orthoscopic eyepiece, Figure 105<i>a</i>, as a substitute with great
advantage in the matter of reflections.</p>

<p>The loss of light in the prism glass is really a serious matter,
between reflection at the surfaces and absorption in the thick
masses of glass necessary in the prisms. If of any size the transmitted
light is not much over one-half of that received, very
seldom above 60%. If the instrument is properly designed the
apparent field is in the neighborhood of 45°, substantially flat
and fairly evenly illuminated. Warning should here be given
however that many binoculars are on the market in which the
field is far from flat and equally far from being uniform.</p>

<p>In many instances the prisms are too small to take the whole
bundle of rays from the objective back to the image plane without
cutting down the marginal light considerably. Even when
the field is apparently quite flat this fault of uneven illumination
may exist, and in a glass for astronomical uses it is highly
objectionable.</p>

<p>Before picking out a binocular for a study of the sky make very
careful trial of the field with respect to flatness and clean definition
of objects up to the very edge. Then judge as accurately
as you may of the uniformity of illumination, if possible by observation
on two stars about the radius of the field apart. It should
be possible to observe them in any part of the field without
detectable change in their apparent brilliancy.</p>

<p>If the objectives are easily removable unscrew one of them to
obtain a clear idea as to the actual size of the prisms.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> Look out,

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span></p>
<p>The objectives of prism glasses usually run from &frac34; inch to 1&frac12;
inch in diameter, and the powers from 6 to 12. The bigger the
objectives the better, provided the prisms are of ample size, while
higher power than 6 or 8 is generally unnecessary and disadvantageous.
Occasional glasses of magnifying power 12 to 20 or
more are to be found but such powers are inconveniently great
for an instrument used without support. Do not forget that a
first class monocular prism glass is extremely convenient and
satisfactory in use, to say nothing of being considerably less in
price than the instrument for two eyes. A monocular prism
glass, by the way, makes an admirable finder when fitted with
coarse cross lines in the eyepiece. It is particularly well suited
to small telescopes without circles.</p>

<p>Numerous modifications of Porro’s inverting prisms have been
made adapting them to different specific purposes. Of these a
single familiar example will suffice as showing the way in which
the Porro prism system can be treated by mere rearrangement of
the prismatic elements. In Fig. 121 is shown a special Zeiss
binocular capable of extreme stereoscopic effect. It is formed of
two Porro prism telescopes with the rays brought into the objectives
at right angles to the axis of the instrument by a right angled
prism external to the objective.</p>

<p>The apertures of these prisms appear pointing forward in the
cut. As shown they are in a position of maximum stereoscopic
effect.</p>

<p>Being hinged the tubes can be swung up from the horizontal
position, in which latter the objectives are separated by something
like eight times the interocular distance. The stereoscopic
effect with the tubes horizontal is of course greatly exaggerated
so that it enables one to form a fair judgment as to the relative
position of somewhat distant objects, a feature useful in locating
shell bursts.</p>

<p>The optical structure of one of the pair of telescopes is shown in
Fig. 122 in which the course of the entering ray can be traced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
through the exterior prism of the objective and the remainder of
the reversing train and thence through the eyepiece. This
prism erecting system is obviously
derived from the “Lunette à
Napoleon Troisiéme” by bringing
down the prism <i>B</i> upon the corresponding
half <i>A</i> and cementing it
thereto, meanwhile placing the
objective immediately under <i>A</i>.</p>

</div>

<p>One occasionally meets prismatic
inverting systems differing considerably
from the Porro forms. Perhaps the best known of
these is the so called roof prism due to Prof. Abbé, Fig. 123, and
occasionally useful in that the entering and emerging rays lie in
the same straight line, thus forming a direct vision system.
Looking at it as we did at the Porro system a vertical element in
front of the prism is reversed in reflection from the two surfaces
a and b, while a corresponding horizontal element is reflected
flatwise so far as these are concerned, but is turned end for end by
reflection at the roof surfaces c and d, thus giving complete
inversion.</p>

<p>In practice the prism is made as shown, in three parts, two of
them right angled prisms, the third containing the roof surfaces.
The extreme precision required in figuring the roof forms a considerable
obstacle to the production of such prisms in quantity
and while they have found convenient use in certain special
instruments like gunsights, where direct vision is useful, they are
not extensively employed for general purposes, although both
monocular and binocular instruments have been constructed
by their aid.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_162.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 123.</span>—Abbé Roof Prism.</div>
</div>

<p>One other variety of prism involving the roof principle has
found some application in field glasses manufactured by the firm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
of Hensoldt. The prism form used is shown in Fig. 124. This
like other forms of roof prism is less easy to make than the conventional
Porro type. Numerous inverting and laterally reflecting
prisms are in use for specific purposes. Some of them are highly
ingenious and remarkably well adapted
for their use, but hardly can be said to
form a material portion of telescope
practice. They belong rather to the
technique of special instruments like
gunsights and periscopes, while some of
them have been devised chiefly as ingenious
substitutes for the simpler Porro
forms.</p>

<p>Most prism telescopes both monocular
and binocular are generally made
on one or the other of the Porro forms.
This is particularly true of the large
binoculars which are occasionally constructed. Porro’s second
form with the sphenoid prisms seems to be best adapted to
cases where shortening of the instrument is not a paramount
consideration. For example, some Zeiss short focus telescopes
are regularly made in binocular form, and supplied with inverting
systems composed of two sphenoid prisms, and with oculars constructed
on the exact principle of the triple nose-piece of a
microscope, so that three powers are immediately available
to the observer.</p>

<div class="figright">

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 124.</span>—Hensoldt Prism.</div>
</div>

<p>Still less commonly binocular telescopes of considerable
aperture are constructed, primarily for astronomical use, being
provided with prismatic inversion for terrestrial employment,
but more particularly in order to gain by the lateral displacement
of a Porro system the space necessary for two objectives of
considerable size. As we have already seen, the practical
diameter of objectives in a binocular is limited to a trifle over
2 inches unless space is so gained. The largest prismatic binocular
as yet constructed is one made years ago by the Clarks, of 6&frac14;
inches objective aperture and 92&frac14; inches focal length. So big and
powerful an instrument obviously would give admirable binocular
views of the heavens and so accurately was it constructed that the
reports of its performance were exceedingly good. The same
firm has made a good many similar binoculars of 3 inch and
above, of which a typical example of 4 inch aperture and 60<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
inch focal length is shown in Fig. 125. In this case the erecting
systems were of Porro’s first form, and were provided with Kellner
oculars of very wide field. These binoculars constructions in
instruments of such size, however well made and agreeable for
terrestrial observation, hardly justify the expense for purely
astronomical use.</p>

<small>ACCESSORIES</small></h2>


<p>Aside from the ordinary equipment of oculars various accessories
form an important part of the observer’s equipment, their
number and character depending on the instrument in use and
the purposes to which it is devoted.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_165.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 126.</span>—Star Diagonal.</div>
</div>

<p>First in general usefulness are several special forms of eyepiece
equipment supplementary to the usual oculars. At the head of
the list is the ordinary star diagonal for the easier viewing of
objects near the zenith here shown in Fig. 126. It is merely a
tube, <i>A</i>, fitting the draw tube of the telescope, with a slotted side
tube <i>B</i>, at a right angle, into which the ordinary ocular fits, and a
right angled prism <i>C</i> with its two faces perpendicular respectively
to the axes of the main and side tubes, and the hypothenuse face
at 45° to each. The beam coming down the tube is totally
reflected at this face and brought to focus at the ocular. The
lower end of the tube is closed by a cap to exclude dust.</p>

<p>One looks, by help of this, horizontally at zenith stars, or, if
observing objects at rather high altitude, views them at a
comfortable angle downward. The prism must be very accu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>rately
made to avoid injury to the definition, but loses only
about 10% of the light, and adds greatly to the comfort of
observing.</p>

<p>Of almost equal importance is the solar diagonal devised by
Sir John Herschel, Fig. 127. Here the tube structure <i>A</i>, <i>B</i>, is
quite the same as in Fig. 126 but the right angled prism is
replaced by a simple elliptical prism <i>C</i> of small angle, 10° or less,
with its upper face accurately plane and at 45° to the axes of the
tubes, resting on a lining tube <i>D</i> cut off as shown. In viewing
the sun only about 5% of the light (and heat) is reflected at
this upper surface to form the image at the eye piece.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_166.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 127.</span>—Solar Diagonal.</div>
</div>

<p>Any reflection from the lower polished surface is turned aside
out of the field, while the remainder of the radiation passes
through the prism <i>C</i> and is concentrated below it. To prevent
scorching the observer the lower end of the tube is capped at <i>E</i>,
but the cap has side perforations to provide circulation for the
heated air. Using such a prism, the remnant of light reflected
can be readily toned down by a neutral tinted glass over the
ocular.</p>

<p>In the telescopes of 3 inches and less aperture, and ordinary focal
ratio, a plane parallel disc of very dark glass over the ocular gives
sufficient protection to the eye. This glass is preferably of
neutral tint, and commonly is a scant 1/16 inch thick. Some
observers prefer other tints than neutral. A green and a red glass
superimposed give good results and so does a disc of the deepest
shade of the so-called Noviweld glass, which is similar in effect.</p>

<p>With an aperture as large as 3 inches a pair of superimposed dark<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
glasses is worth while, for the two will not break simultaneously
from the heat and there will be time to get the eye away in
safety. A broken sunshade is likely to cost the observer a
permanent scotoma, blindness in a small area of the retina which
will neither get better nor worse as time goes on.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/i_167.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 128.</span>—Diagram of Polarizing
Eyepiece.</div>
</div>

<p>Above 3 inches aperture the solar prism should be used or, if one
cares to go to fully double the cost, there is nothing more comfortable
to employ in solar observation
than the polarizing eye piece,
Fig. 128. This shows schematically
the arrangement of the device. It
depends on the fact that a ray of light
falling on a surface of common glass
at an angle of incidence of approximately
57° is polarized by the reflection
so that while it is freely reflected
if it falls again on a surface parallel to
the first, it is absorbed if it falls at the
same incidence on a surface at right
angles to the first.</p>

<p>Thus in Fig. 128 the incident beam
from the telescope falls on the black
glass surface <i>a</i> at 57° incidence, is
again reflected from the parallel mirror
<i>b</i>, and then passed on, parallel to its
original path, to the lower pair of
mirrors <i>c</i>, <i>d</i>. The purpose of the second reflection is to polarize
the residual light which through the convergence of the rays
was incompletely polarized at the first.</p>

<p>The lower pair of mirrors <i>c</i>, <i>d</i>, again twice reflect the light at the
polarizing angle, and, in the position shown, pass it on to the
ocular diminished only by the four reflections. But if the second
pair of mirrors be rotated together about a line parallel to <i>b c</i> as an
axis the transmitted light begins to fade out, and when they have
been turned 90°, so that their planes are inclined 90° to <i>a</i> and <i>b</i>
(= 33° to the plane of the paper), the light is substantially
extinguished.</p>

<p>Thus by merely turning the second pair of mirrors the solar
image can be reduced in brilliancy to any extent whatever,
without modifying its color in any way. The typical form given
to the polarizing eyepiece is similar to Fig. 129. Here <i>t</i>_2 is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
box containing the polarizing mirrors, <i>a b</i>, fitted to the draw
tube, but for obvious reasons eccentric with it, <i>t</i>_1 is the rotating
box containing the “analysing” mirrors <i>c</i>, <i>d</i>, and <i>a</i> is the ocular
turning with it.</p>

<p>Sometimes the polarizing mirrors are actually a pair of Herschel
prisms as in Fig. 126, facing each other, thus getting rid of much
of the heat. Otherwise the whole set of mirrors is of black glass
to avoid back reflections. In simpler constructions single mirrors
are used as polarizer and analyser, and in fact there are many
variations on the polarizing solar eyepiece involving about the
same principles.</p>

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 129.</span>—Polarizing Solar Eyepiece.</div>
</div>

<p>In any solar eyepiece a set of small diaphragms with holes
from perhaps 1/64 inch up are useful in cutting down the general
glare from the surface outside of that under scrutiny. These
may be dropped upon the regular diaphragm of the ocular or
conveniently arranged in a revolving diaphragm like that used
with the older photographic lenses.</p>

<p>The measurement of celestial objects has developed a large
group of important auxiliaries in the micrometers of very varied
forms. The simplest needs little description, since it consists
merely of a plane parallel disc of glass fitting in the focus of a
positive ocular, and etched with a network of uniform squares,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
forming a reticulated micrometer by which the distance of
one object from another can be estimated.</p>

<p>It can be readily calibrated by measuring a known distance
or noting the time required for an equatorial star to drift across
the squares parallel to one set of lines. It gives merely a useful
approximation, and accurate measures must be turned over to
more precise instruments.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_169.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 130.</span>—Diagram of Ring Micrometer.</div>
</div>

<p>The ring micrometer due, like so much other valuable apparatus,
to Fraunhofer, is convenient and widely used for determining
positions. It consists, as shown in Fig. 130, of an accurately
turned opaque ring, generally of thin steel, cemented to a plane
parallel glass or otherwise suspended in the center of the eyepiece
field. The whole ring is generally half to two thirds the width of
the field and has a moderate radial width so that both the ingress
and the egress of a star can be conveniently timed.</p>

<p>It depends wholly on the measurement of time as the stars
to be compared drift across the ring while the telescope is fixed,
and while a clock or chronometer operating a sounder is a
desirable adjunct one can do pretty well with a couple of stop
watches since only differential times are required.</p>

<p>For full directions as to its use consult Loomis’ Practical
Astronomy, a book which should be in the library of every one
who has the least interest in celestial observations. Suffice it to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
say here that the ring micrometer is very simple in use, and the
computation of the results is quite easy. In Fig. 130 F is the
edge of the field, R the ring, and <i>a b</i>, <i>a′b′</i>, the paths of the stars
<i>s</i> and <i>s′</i>, the former well into the field, the latter just within the
ring. The necessary data comprise the time taken by each star
to transverse the ring, and the radius of the ring in angular
measure, whence the difference in R. A. or Dec, can be obtained.<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<p>Difference of R. A. = &frac12; (t′-t)&frac12; (T′-T) where (T′-T)
is the time taken for transit of second star. To obtain
differences of declination one declination should be known at
least approximately, and the second estimated from its relative
position in the ring or otherwise. Then with these tentative
values proceed as follows.</p>

<p>
Put x = angle <i>aob</i> and <i>x</i>′ = angle <i>a′o′b′</i><br />
<br />
Also let d  = approximate declination of <i>s</i> and<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">d′ = approximate declination of <i>s′</i></span><br />
</p>

<p>Then sin x = (15/2r) cos d (T′-T)</p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 2.4em;">sin x′ = (15/2r) cos d′ (t′-t) and finally</span><br /><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
Difference of Dec. = r (cos x′-cos x), when both arcs are on
the same side of center of ring. If on opposite sides, Diff. = r
(cos x′ + cos x).</p>

<p>There is also now and then used a square bar micrometer,
consisting of an opaque square set with a diagonal in the line of
diurnal motion. It is used in much the same way as the ring,
and the reductions are substantially the same. It has some
points of convenience but is little used, probably on account of
the great difficulty of accurate construction and the requirement,
for advantageous use, that the telescope should be on a well
adjusted equatorial stand.<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> The ring micrometer works reasonably
well on any kind of steady mount, requires no illumination
of the field and is in permanent working adjustment.</p>

<p>Still another type of micrometer capable of use without a
clock-drive is the double image instrument. In its usual form
it is based on the principle that if a lens is cut in two along a
diameter and the halves are slightly displaced along the cut all
objects will be seen double, each half of the lens forming its
own set of images.</p>

<p>Conversely, if one choses two objects in the united field these
can be brought together by sliding the halves of the lens as before,
and the extent of the movement needed measures the distance
between them. Any lens in the optical system can be thus used,
from the objective to the eyepiece. Fig. 131 shows a very
simple double image micrometer devised by Browning many
years ago. Here the lens divided is a so-called Barlow lens, a
weak achromatic negative lens sometimes used like a telephoto
lens to lengthen the focus and hence vary the power of a telescope.</p>

<p>This lens is shown at A with the halves widely separated by the
double threaded micrometer screw B, which carries them apart
symmetrically. The ocular proper is shown at C.</p>

<p>Double image micrometers are now mainly of historical
interest, and the principle survives chiefly in the heliometer, a
telescope with the objective divided, and provided with sliding
mechanism of the highest refinement. The special function of
the heliometer is the direct micrometric measurement of stellar
distances too great to be within the practicable range of a filar
micrometer—distances for example up to 1&frac12;° or even more.</p>

<p>The observations with the heliometer are somewhat laborious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
and demand rather intricate corrections, but are capable of great
precision. (See Sir David Gill’s article “Heliometer” in the
Enc. Brit. 11th Ed.). At the present day celestial photography,
with micrometric measurement of the resulting plates, has gone
far in rendering needless visual measurements of distances
above a very few minutes of arc, so that it is somewhat doubtful
whether a large heliometer would again be constructed.</p>

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 132.</span>—Filar Micrometer. (<i>Courtesy of J. B. Lippincott Co.</i>)</div>
</div>

<p>The astronomer’s real arm of precision is the filar micrometer.
This is shown in outline in Fig. 132, the ocular and the plate that
carries it being removed so as to display the working parts. It
consists of a main frame aa, carrying a slide bb, which is moved
by the screws and milled head B. The slide bb carries the vertical
spider line mm, and usually one or more horizontal spider lines,
line mm is the so-called fixed thread of the micrometer, movable
only as a convenience to avoid shifting the telescope.</p>

<p>On bb moves the micrometer slide cc, carrying the movable
spider line nn and the comb which records, with mm as reference
line, the whole revolutions of the micrometer screw C. The
ocular sometimes has a sliding motion of its own on cc, to get it
positioned to the best advantage. In use one star is set upon
mm by the screw B and then C is turned until nn bisects the
other star.</p>

<p>Then the exact turns and fraction of a turn can be read off
on the comb and divided head of C, and reduced to angular
measure by the known constant of the micrometer, usually
determined by the time of passage of a nearly equatorial star
along the horizontal thread when mm, nn, are at a definite setting</p>

<p>apart. (Then r = (15(t′-t) cos d)/N where r is the value of a
revolution in seconds of arc, N the revolutions apart of mm, nn,
and t and d as heretofore.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span></p>

<p>Very generally the whole system of slides is fitted to a
graduated circle, to which the fixed horizontal thread is diametral.
Then by turning the micrometer until the horizontal threads cut
the two objects under comparison, their position angle with
reference to a graduated circle can be read off. This angle is
conventionally counted from 0° to 360° from north around
through east.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 133.</span>—Filar Position Micrometer.</div>

<p>Figure 133 shows the micrometer constructed by the Clarks for
their 24 inch equatorial of the Lowell Observatory. Here A is the
head of the main micrometer screw of which the whole turns are
reckoned on the counter H in lieu of the comb of Fig. 132. B is
the traversing screw for the fixed wire system, C the clamping
screw of the position circle, D its setting pinion, E the rack
motion for shifting the ocular, F the reading glass for the position
circle, and G the little electric lamp for bright wire illumination.
The parts correspond quite exactly with the diagram of Fig. 132
but the instrument is far more elegant in design than the earlier
forms of micrometer and fortunately rid of the oil lamps that were
once in general use. A small electric lamp with reflector throws
a little light on the spider lines—just enough to show them distinctly.
Or sometimes a faint light is thus diffused in the
field against which the spider lines show dark.</p>

<p>Commonly either type of illumination can be used and modified
as occasion requires. The filar micrometer is seldom used<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
on small telescopes, since to work easily with it the instrument
should be permanently mounted and clock-driven. Good work
was done by some of the early observers without these aids, but
at the cost of infinite pains and much loss of time.</p>

<p>The clock drive is in fact a most important adjunct of the
telescope when used for other purposes than ordinary visual
observations, though for simple seeing a smooth working slow
motion in R. A. answers well. The driving clock from the horological
view-point is rudimentary. It consists essentially of a
weight-driven, or sometimes spring-driven, drum, turning by a
simple gear connection a worm which engages a carefully cut
gear wheel on the polar axis, while prevented from running
away by gearing up to a fast running fly-ball governor, which
applies friction to hold the clockwork down to its rate if the speed
rises by a minute amount. There is no pendulum in the ordinary
sense, the regularity depending on the uniformity of the total
friction—that due to the drive plus that applied by the governor.</p>

<p>Figure 134 shows a simple and entirely typical driving clock
by Warner &amp; Swasey. Here A is the main drum with its winding
gear at B, C is the bevel gear, which is driven from another
carried by A, and serves to turn the worm shaft D; E marks
the fly balls driven by the multiplying gearing plainly visible.
The governor acts at a predetermined rotation speed to lift the
spinning friction disc F against its fixed mate, which can be
adjusted by the screw G.</p>

<p>The fly-balls can be slightly shifted in effective position to
complete the regulation. These simple clocks, of which there are
many species differing mainly in the details of the friction device,
are capable of excellent precision if the work of driving the telescope
is kept light.</p>

<p>For large and heavy instruments, particularly if used for photographic
work where great precision is required, it is difficult to
keep the variations of the driving friction within the range of
compensation furnished by the governor friction alone, and in
such case recourse is often taken to constructions in which the
fly balls act as relay to an electrically controlled brake, or in
which the driving power is supplied by an electric motor suitably
governed either continuously or periodically. For such work
independent hand guiding mechanism is provided to supplement
the clockwork. For equatorials of the smallest sizes, say 3 to 4
inches aperture, spring operated driving clocks are occasionally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
used. The general plan of operation is quite similar to the
common weight driven forms, and where the weights to be
carried are not excessive such clocks do good work and serve a

<p>An excellent type of the simple spring driving clock is shown in
Fig. 136 as constructed by Zeiss. Here 1 is the winding gear,
2 the friction governor, and 3 the regulating gear. It will be seen
that the friction studs are carried by the fly balls themselves,
somewhat as in Fraunhofers’ construction a century since, and
the regulation is very easily and quickly made by adjusting the
height of the conical friction surface above the balls.</p>

<p>For heavier work the same makers generally use a powerful
weight driven train with four fly-balls and electric seconds control,
sometimes with the addition of electric motor slow motions to
adjust for R. A. in both directions.</p>

</div>

<p>Figure 135 is a rather powerful clock of analogous form by
the Clarks. It differs a little in its mechanism and especially
in the friction gear in which the bearing disc is picked up by
a delicately set latch and carried just long enough to effect
the regulation. It is really remarkable that clockworks of so
simple character as these should perform as well as experience
shows that they do. In a few instances clocks have depended
on air-fans for their regulating force, something after the manner
of the driving gear of a phonograph, but though rather successful
for light work they have found little favor in the task of
driving equatorials. An excellent type of a second genus is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
pendulum controlled driving clock due to Sir David Gill. This
has a powerful weight-driven train with the usual fly-ball governor.
But the friction gear is controlled by a contact-making
seconds pendulum in the manner shown diagrammatically in
Fig. 137. Two light leather tipped rods each controlled by an
electro magnet act upon an auxiliary brake disc carried by the
governor spindle which is set for normal speed with one brake
rod bearing lightly on it. Exciting the corresponding magnet
relieves the pressure and accelerates the clock, while exciting the
other adds braking effect and slows it.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_177.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 136.</span>—Spring Operated Driving Clock.</div>
</div>

<p>In Fig. 137 is shown from the original paper, (M. N. Nov.,
1873), the very ingenious selective control mechanism. At P
is suspended the contact-making seconds-pendulum making
momentary contact by the pin Q with a mercury globule at R.
Upon a spindle of the clock which turns once a second is fixed a
vulcanite disc γ, δ, ε, σ. This has a rim of silver broken at the
points γ, δ, ε, σ, by ivory spacers covering 3° of circumference.
On each side of this disc is another, smaller, and with a complete
silver rim. One, ηθ, is shown, connected with the contact
spring V; its mate η′θ′, on the other side contacts with U, while
a third contact K bears on the larger disc.</p>

<p>The pair of segments σ, γ, and δ, ε, are connected to η θ, the
other pair of segments to η′ θ′. Now suppose the discs turning
with the arrows: If K rests on one of the insulated points when
the pendulum throws the battery C Z into circuit nothing happens.
If the disc is gaining on the pendulum, K, instead of resting on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
γ as shown will contact with segment γ, σ, and actuate a relay
via V, exciting the appropriate brake magnet.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_178.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 137.</span>—Sir David Gill’s Electric Control.</div>
</div>

<p>If the disc is losing, K contacts with segment γ, δ, and current
will pass via η′θ′ and U to a relay that operates the other
brake magnet and lets the clock accelerate. A fourth disc
(not shown) on the same spindle is entirely insulated on its
edge except at points corresponding to γ and ε, and with a
contact spring like K.</p>

<p>If the disc is neither gaining nor losing when the pendulum
makes contact, current flows via this fourth disc and sets the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
relay on the mid-point ready to act when needed. This clock
is the prototype of divers electrically-braked driving clocks with
pendulum control, and proved beautifully precise in action, like
various kindred devices constructed since, though the whole
genus is somewhat expensive and intricate.</p>

<p>The modern tendency in driving apparatus for telescopes,
particularly large instruments, is to utilize an electric motor for
the source of power, using a clock mechanism merely for the
purpose of accurately regulating the rate of the motor. We thus
have the driving clock in its simplest form as a purely mechanical
device worked by a sensitive fly-ball governor. The next
important type is that in which the clock drive is precisely
regulated by a pendulum clock, the necessary governing
power being applied electrically as in Fig. 137 or sometimes
mechanically.</p>

<p>Finally we come to the type now under consideration where
the instrument itself is motor driven and the function of the
clock is that of regulating the motor. A very good example of
such a drive is the Gerrish apparatus used for practically all the
instruments at the various Harvard observatory stations, and
which has proved extremely successful even for the most trying
work of celestial photography. The schematic arrangement of
the apparatus is shown in Fig. 138. Here an electric motor
shown in diagram in 1, Fig. 138, is geared down to approximately
the proper speed for turning the right ascension axis of the
telescope. It is supplied with current either from a battery or
in practice from the electric supply which may be at hand.
This motor is operated on a 110 volt circuit which supplies
current through the switch 2 which is controlled by the low
voltage clock circuit running through the magnet 3. The
clock circuit can be closed and opened at two points, one controlled
by the seconds pendulum 5, the other at 7 by the stud
on the timing wheel geared to the motor for one revolution
per second. There is also a shunt around the pendulum break,
closed by the magnet switch at 6. This switch is mechanically
connected to the switch 2 by the rod 4, so that the pair open and
close together.</p>

<p>The control operates as follows: Starting with the motor at
rest, the clock circuit is switched on, switches 2, 6 being open
and 7 closed. At the first beat of the pendulum 2, 6 closes and
the current, shunted across the loop containing 5, holds 2<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
closed until the motor has started and broken the clock circuit
at the timer. The fly-wheel carries on until the pendulum
again closes the power circuit via 2, 6, and current stays on the
motor until the timer has completed its revolution.</p>

<p>This goes on as the motor speeds up, the periodic power supply
being shortened as the timer breaks it earlier owing to the acceleration,
until the motor comes to its steady speed at which the
power is applied just long enough to maintain uniformity. If
the motor for any cause tends to overspeed the cut-off is earlier,
while slowing down produces a longer power-period bringing the
speed back to normal. The power period is generally &frac14; to &frac12;
second. The power supplied to the motor is very small even in
the example here shown, only 1 ampere at 110 volts.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_180.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 138.</span>—Diagram of Gerrish Electric Control.</div>
</div>

<p>The actual proportion of a revolution during which current is
supplied the motor is therefore rigorously determined by the
clock pendulum, and the motor is selected so that its revolutions
are exactly timed to this clock pendulum which has no work to
do other than the circuit closing, and can hence be regulated to
keep accurate time. The small fly-wheel (9), the weight of which
is carefully adjusted with respect to the general amount of work
to be done, attached to the motor shaft, effectively steadies its
action during the process of government. This Gerrish type
has been variously modified in detail to suit the instruments to
which it has been applied, always following however the same
fundamental principles.</p>

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 139.</span>—Gerrish Drive on 24 inch Reflector.</div>
</div>

<p>An admirable example of the application of this drive is
shown in Fig. 139, the 24 inch reflector at the Harvard Observatory.
The mount is a massive open fork, and the motor drive
is seen on the right of the mount. There are here two motors,
ordinary fan motors in size. The right hand motor carries the
fly-wheel and runs steadily on under the pendulum control. The
other, connected to the same differential gear as the driving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
motor, serves merely for independent regulation and can be run
in either direction by the observer to speed or slow the motion in
R. A. These examples of clock drive are merely typical of those
which have proved to be successful in use for various service, light
and heavy. There are almost innumerable variations on clocks
constructed on one or another of the general lines here indicated,
so many variations in fact that one almost might say there are
few driving clocks which are not in some degree special.</p>

<p>The tendency at present is for large instruments very distinctly
toward a motor-driven mechanism operating on the right
ascension axis, and governed in one of a considerable variety of
ways by an actual clock pendulum. For smaller instruments the
old mechanical clock, often fitted with electric brake gear and
now and then pendulum regulated, is capable of very excellent
work.</p>

<p>The principle of the spectroscope is rudimentarily simple, in
the familiar decomposition of white light into rainbow colors by
a prism. One gets the phenomena neatly by holding a narrow
slit in a large piece of cardboard at arms length and looking at it
through a prism held with its edge parallel to the slit. If the
light were not white but of a mixture of definite colors each color
present would be represented by a separate image of the slit
instead of the images being merged into a continuous colored
band.</p>

<p>With the sun as source the continuous spectrum is crossed by
the dark lines first mapped by Fraunhofer, each representing
the absorption by a relatively cool exterior layer of some substance
that at a higher temperature below gives a bright line in
exactly the same position.</p>

<p>The actual construction of the astronomical spectroscope
varies greatly according to its use. In observations on the sun
the distant slit is brought nearer for convenience by placing it in
the focus of a small objective pointed toward the prisms (the
collimator) and the spectrum is viewed by a telescope of moderate
magnifying power to disclose more of detail. Also, since there is
extremely bright light available, very great dispersion can be used,
obtained by several or many prisms, so that the spectrum is
both fairly wide, (the length of the slit) and extremely long.</p>

<p>In trying to get the spectrum of a star the source is a point,
equivalent to an extremely minute length of a very narrow slit.
Therefore no actual slit is necessary and the chief trouble is to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
get the spectrum wide enough and bright enough to examine.</p>

<p>The simplest form of stellar spectroscope and the one in most
common use with small telescopes is the ocular spectroscope
arranged much like Fig. 140. This fits into the eye tube of a
telescope and the McClean form made by Browning of London
consists of an ordinary casing with screw collar <i>B</i>, a cylindrical
lens <i>C</i>, a direct vision prism <i>c</i>, <i>f</i>, <i>c</i>, and an eye-cap <i>A</i>.</p>

<p>The draw tube is focussed on the star image as with any other
ocular, and the light is delivered
through <i>C</i> to the prism
face nearly parallel, and
thence goes to the eye, after
dispersion by the prism. This
consists of a central prism, <i>f</i>,
of large angle, made of extremely
dense flint, to which
are cemented a pair of prisms
of light crown <i>c</i>, <i>c</i>, with their
bases turned away from that
of <i>f</i>.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/i_183.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 140.—McClean Ocular
 Spectroscope.</div>
</div>

<p>We have already seen that the dispersions of glasses vary very
much more than their refractions so that with proper choice of
materials and angles the refraction of <i>f</i> is entirely compensated
for some chosen part of the spectrum, while its dispersion quite
overpowers that of the crown prisms and gives a fairly long
available spectrum.</p>

<p>The cylindrical lens <i>C</i> merely serves to stretch out the tiny
round star image into a short line thereby giving the resulting
spectrum width enough to examine comfortably. The weak
cylindrical lens is sometimes slipped over the eye end of the
prisms to give the needed width of spectrum instead of putting it
ahead of the prisms.</p>

<p>A small instrument of this kind used with a telescope of 3
inches to 5 inches aperture gives a fairly good view of the spectra
of starts above second or third magnitude, the qualities of tolerably
bright comets and nebulæ and so forth. The visibility of
stellar spectra varies greatly according to their type, those with
heavy broad bands being easy to observe, while for the same
stellar magnitude spectra with many fine lines may be quite
beyond examination. Nevertheless a little ocular spectroscope
enables one to see many things well worth the trouble of observing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span></p>

<p>With the larger instruments, say 6 or 8 inches, one can well take
advantage of the greater light to use a spectroscope with a slit,
which gives somewhat sharper definition and also an opportunity
to measure the spectrum produced.</p>

<p>An excellent type of such an instrument is that shown in Fig.
141, due to Professor Abbé. The construction is analogous to
Fig. 140. The ocular is a Huyghenian one with the slit mechanism
(controlled by a milled head) at A in the usual place of the
diaphragm. The slit is therefore
in the focus of the eye lens,
which serves as collimating lens.
Above is the direct vision system
J with the usual prisms which
are slightly adjustable laterally
by the screw P and spring Q.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i_184.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 141.</span>—Abbé Ocular Spectroscope.</div>
</div>

<p>At N is a tiny transparent
scale of wave lengths illuminated
by a faint light reflected from
the mirror O, and in the focus of
the little lens R, which transfers
it by reflection from the front
face of the prism to the eye,
alongside the edge of the spectrum.
One therefore sees the
spectrum marked off by a bright
line wave-length scale.</p>

<p>The pivot K and clamp L enable the whole to be swung side-wise
so that one can look through the widened slit, locate the
star, close the slit accurately upon it and swing on the prisms.
M is the clamp in position angle. Sometimes a comparison
prism is added, together with suitable means for throwing in
spectra of gases or metals alongside that of the star, though these
refinements are more generally reserved for instruments of
higher dispersion.</p>

<p>To win the advantage of accurate centering of the star in the
field gained by the swing-out of the spectroscope in Fig. 141
simple instruments like Fig. 140 are sometimes mounted with
an ordinary ocular in a double nose-piece like that used for
microscope objectives, so that either can be used at will.</p>

<p>Any ordinary pocket spectroscope, with or without scale or a
comparison prism over part of the slit, can in fact be fitted to an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
adapter and used with the star focussed on the slit and a cylindrical
lens, if necessary, as an eye-cap.</p>

<p>Such slit spectroscopes readily give the characteristics of
stellar spectra and those of the brighter nebulæ or of comets.
They enable one to identify the more typical lines and compare
them with terrestrial sources, and save for solar work are about
all the amateur observer finds use for.</p>

<p>For serious research a good deal more of an instrument is
required, with a large telescope to collect the light, and means for
photographing the spectra for permanent record. The cumulative
effect of prolonged exposures makes it possible easily to
record spectra much too faint to see with the same aperture, and
exposures are often extended to many hours.</p>

<p>Spectroscopes for such use commonly employ dense flint prisms
of about 60° refracting angle and refractive index of about 1.65,
one, two, or three of these being fitted to the instrument as
occasion requires. A fine example by Brashear is shown in Fig.
142, arranged for visual work on the 24 inch Lowell refractor.
Here A is the slit, B the prism box, C the observing telescope, D
the micrometer ocular with electric lamp for illuminating the
wires, and E the link motion that keeps the prism faces at equal
angles with collimator and observing telescope when the angle
between these is changed to observe different parts of the spectrum.
This precaution is necessary to maintain the best of
definition.</p>

<p>When photographs are to be taken the observing telescope is
unscrewed and a photographic lens and camera put in its place.
If the brightness of the object permits, three prisms are installed,
turning the beam 180° into a camera braced to the same frame
alongside the slit.</p>

<p>For purely photographic work, too, the objective prism used
by Fraunhofer for the earliest observation of stellar spectra is in
wide use. It is a prism fitted in front of the objective with its
refracting faces making equal angles with the telescope and the
region to be observed, respectively. Its great advantages are
small loss of light and the ability to photograph many spectra at
once, for all the stars in the clear field of the instrument leave
their images spread out into spectra upon the photographic
plate.</p>

<p>Figure 143 shows such an objective prism mounted in front of
an astrographic objective. The prism is rotatable into any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
azimuth about the axis of the objective and by the scale i and
clamping screw r can have its refracting face adjusted with
respect to that axis to the best position for photographing any
part of the spectrum. Such an arrangement is typical of those
used for small instruments say from 3 inches to 6 inches aperture.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_186.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"> <span class="smcap">Fig. 142.</span>—Typical Stellar Spectroscope.</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span></p>

<p>For larger objectives the prism is usually of decidedly smaller
angle, and, if the light warrants high dispersion, several prisms
in tandem are used. The objective prism does its best work when
applied to true photographic objectives of the portrait lens type
which yield a fairly large field. It is by means of big instruments
of such sort that the spectra for the magnificent Draper Catalogue
have been secured by the
Harvard Observatory, mostly at the
Arequipa station. In photographing
with the objective prism the spectra
are commonly given the necessary
width for convenient examination by
changing just a trifle the rate of the
driving clock so that there is a slight
and gradual drift in R. A. The refracting
edge of the prism being turned
parallel to the diurnal motion this drift
very gradually and uniformly widens
the spectrum to the extent of a few
minutes of arc during the whole
exposure.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/i_187.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 143.</span>—Simple Objective
 Prism.</div>
</div>

<p>When one comes to solar spectroscopy
one meets an entirely different
situation. In stellar work the difficulty
is to get enough light, and the
tendency is toward large objectives
of relatively short focal length and
spectroscopes of moderate dispersion.
In solar studies there is ample light,
and the main thing is to get an image
big enough to be scrutinized in detail with very great dispersion.</p>

<p>Especially is this true in the study of the chromospheric flames
that rim the solar disc and blaze over its surface. To examine
these effectively the spectroscope should have immense dispersion
with a minimum amount of stray light in the field to interfere
with vision of delicate details.</p>

<p>In using a spectroscope like Fig. 142, if one turned the slit
toward the landscape, the instrument being removed from the
telescope and the slit opened wide, he could plainly see its various
features, refracted through the prism, and appearing in such
color as corresponded to the part of the spectrum in the line of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
the observing telescope. In other words one sees refracted
images quite distinctly in spite of the bending of the rays. With
high dispersion the image seen is practically monochromatic.</p>

<p>Now if one puts the spectroscope in place, brings the solar
image tangent to the slit and then cautiously opens the slit, he
sees the bright continuous spectrum of the sky close to the sun,
plus any light of the particular color for which the observing
telescope is set, which may proceed from the edge of the solar
disc. Thus, if the setting is for the red line of hydrogen (C), one
sees the hydrogen glow that plays in fiery pillars of cloud about
the sun’s limb quite plainly through the opened slit, on a background
of light streaming from the adjacent sky. To see most
clearly one must use great dispersion to spread this background
out into insignificance, must keep other stray light out of the
field, and limit his view to the opened slit.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_188.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 144.</span>—Diagram of Evershed Solar Spectroscope.</div>
</div>

<p>To these ends early solar spectroscopes had many prisms in
tandem, up to a dozen or so, kept in proper relation by complicated
linkages analogous to the simple one shown in Fig. 142.
Details can be found in almost any astronomical work of 40
years ago. They were highly effective in giving dispersion but
neither improved the definition nor cut out light reflected back
and forth from their many surfaces.</p>

<p>Of late simpler constructions have come into use of which an
excellent type is the spectroscope designed by Mr. Evershed and
shown in diagram in Fig. 144. Here the path of the rays is from
the slit through the collimator objective, then through a very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
powerful direct vision system, giving a dispersion of 30° through
the visible spectrum, then by reflection from the mirror through
a second such system, and thence to the observing telescope.
The mirror is rotated to get various parts of the spectrum into
view, and the micrometer screw that turns it gives means for
making accurate measurement of wave lengths.</p>

<p>There are but five reflecting surfaces in the prism system (for
the cemented prism surfaces do not count for much) as against
more than 20 in one of the older instruments of similar power,
and as in other direct vision systems the spectrum lines are
substantially straight instead of being strongly curved as with
multiple single prisms. The result is the light, compact, and
powerful spectroscope shown complete in Fig. 145, equally well
fitted for observing the sun’s prominences and the detailed
spectrum from his surface.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_189.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 145.</span>—Evershed Solar Spectroscope.</div>
</div>

<p>In most of the solar spectroscopes made at the present time
the prisms are replaced by a diffraction grating. The original
gratings made by Fraunhofer were made of wire. Two parallel
screws of extremely fine thread formed two opposite sides of a
brass frame. A very fine wire was then wound over these
screws, made fast by solder on one side of each, and then cut
away on the other, so as to leave a grating of parallel wires with
clear spaces between.</p>

<p>Today the grating is generally ruled by an automatic ruling
engine upon a polished plate of speculum metal. The diamond
point carried by the engine cuts very smooth and fine parallel
furrows, commonly from 10,000 to 20,000 to the inch. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
spaces between the furrows reflect brilliantly and produce
diffraction spectra.<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

<p>When a grating is used instead of prisms the instrument is
commonly set up as shown in Fig. 146. Here <i>A</i> is the collimator
with slit upon which the solar image light falls, <i>B</i> is the observing
telescope, and <i>C</i> the grating set in a rotatable mount with a fine
threaded tangent screw to bring any line accurately upon the
cross wires of the ocular.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_190.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 146.</span>—Diagram of Grating Spectroscope.</div>
</div>

<p>The grating gives a series of spectra on each side of the slit,
violet ends toward the slit, and with deviations proportional to
1, 2, 3, 4, etc., times the wave length of the line considered. The
spectra therefore overlap, the ultra violet of the second order
being superimposed on the extreme red of the first order and so
on. Colored screens over the slit or ocular are used to get the
overlying spectra out of the way.</p>

<p>The grating spectroscopes are very advantageous in furnishing
a wide range of available dispersions, and in giving less stray
light than a prism train of equal power. The spectra moreover
are very nearly “normal,” <i>i.e.</i>, the position of each line is proportional
to its wave length instead of the blue being disproportionately
long as in prismatic spectra.</p>

<p>In examining solar prominences the widened slit of a grating
spectroscope shows them foreshortened or stretched to an
amount depending on the angular position of the grating, but the
effect is easily reckoned.<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span></p>
<p>If the slit is nearly closed one sees merely a thin line, irregularly
bright according to the shape of the prominence; a shift of the
slit with respect to the solar image shows a new irregular section
of the prominence in the same monochromatic light.</p>

<p>These simple phenomena form the basis of one of the most
important instruments of solar study—the spectro-heliograph.
This was devised almost simultaneously by G. E. Hale and M.
Deslandres about 30 years ago, and enables photographs of the
sun to be taken in monochromatic light, showing not only the
prominences of the limb but glowing masses of gas scattered all
over the surface.</p>

<p>The principle of the instrument is very simple. The collimator
of a powerful grating spectroscope is provided with a slit the full
length of the solar diameter, arranged to slide smoothly on a
ball-bearing carriage clear across the solar disc. Just in front of
the photographic plate set in the focus of the camera lens is
another narrow sliding slit, which, like a focal plane shutter,
exposes strip after strip of the plate.</p>

<p>The two slits are geared together by a system of levers or
otherwise so that they move at exactly the same uniform rate of
speed. Thus when the front slit is letting through a monochromatic
section of a prominence on the sun’s limb the plate-slit is
at an exactly corresponding position. When the front slit is
exactly across the sun’s center so is the plate slit, at each element
of movement exposing a line of the plate to the monochromatic
image from the moving front slit. The grating can of course be
turned to put any required line into action but it usually is set
for the K line (calcium), which is photographically very brilliant
and shows bright masses of floating vapor all over the sun’s
surface.</p>

<p>Figure 147 shows an early and simple type of Professor Hale’s
instrument. Here A is the collimator with its sliding slit, B the
photographic telescope with its corresponding slide and C the
lever system which connects the slides in perfectly uniform
alignment. The source of power is a very accurately regulated
water pressure cylinder mounted parallel with the collimator.
The result is a complete photograph of the sun taken in monochromatic
light of exactly defined wave length and showing the
precise distribution of the glowing vapor of the corresponding
substance.</p>

<p>Since the spectro-heliograph of Fig. 147, which shows the princi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>ple
remarkably well, there have been made many modifications,
in particular for adapting the scheme to the great horizontal and
vertical fixed telescopes now in use. (For details of these see
Cont. from the Solar Obs. Mt. Wilson, Nos. 3, 4, 23, and others).
The chief difficulty always is to secure entirely smooth and
uniform motion of the two moving elements.</p>

<p>So great and interesting a branch of astronomy is the study of
variable stars that some form of photometer should be part of
the equipment of every telescope in serious use for celestial
observation. An immense amount of useful work has been done
by Argelander’s systematic method of eye observation, but it is
far from being precise enough to disclose many of the most
important features of variability.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span></p>

<p>The conventional way of reckoning by stellar magnitudes is
conducive to loose measurements, since each magnitude of
difference implies a light ratio of which the log is 0.4, <i>i.e.</i>, each
magnitude is 2.512 times brighter than the following one. As a
result of this way of reckoning the light of a star of mag. 9.9 differs
from one of mag. 10.0 not by one per cent but by about nine.
Hence to grasp light variations of small order one must be able to
measure far below 0.1<sup><i>m</i></sup>.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_193.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 148.</span>-Double Image Stellar Photometer.</div>
</div>

<p>The ordinary laboratory photometer enables one to compare
light sources of anywhere near similar color to a probable error
of well under 0.1 per cent, but it allows a comparison between
sharply defined juxtaposed fields from the two illuminants, a
condition much more favorable to precision than the comparison
of two points of light, even if fairly near together.</p>

<p>Stellar photometers may in principle be divided into three
classes. (1) Those in which two actual stars are brought into the
same field and compared by varying the light from one or both in
a known degree. (2) Those which bring a real star into the
field alongside an artificial star, and again bring the two to
equality by a known variation, usually comparing two or more
stars via the same artificial star; (3) those which measure the
light of a star by a definite method of extinguishing it entirely or
just to the verge of disappearance in a known progression. Of
each class there are divers varieties. The type of the first class
may be taken as the late Professor E. C. Pickering’s polarizing
photometer. Its optical principle is shown in Fig. 148. Here
the brightness of two neighboring objects is compared by polarizing
at 90° apart the light received from each and reducing the
resulting images to equality by an analyzing Nicol prism. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
photometer is fully described, with, several other polarizing
instruments, in H. A. Vol. II from which Fig. 148 is taken.</p>

<p>A is a Nicol prism inserted in the ocular <i>B</i>, which revolves carrying
with it a divided circle <i>C</i> read against the index <i>D</i>. In the
tube <i>E</i> which fits the eye end of the telescope, is placed the double
image quartz prism <i>F</i> capable of sliding either way without
rotation by pulling the cord <i>G</i>. With the objects to be compared
in the same field, two images of each appear. By turning the
analyzing Nicol the fainter image of the brighter can always be
reduced to equality with the brighter image of the fainter, and the
amount of rotation measures the required ratio of brightness.<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a>
This instrument works well for objects near enough to be in the
same field of view. The distance between the images can be
adjusted by sliding the prism <i>F</i> back and forth, but the available
range of view is limited to a small fraction of a degree in ordinary
telescopes.</p>

<p>The meridian photometer was designed to avoid this small
scope. The photometric device is substantially the same as
in Fig. 148. The objects compared are brought into the field
by two exactly similar objectives placed at a small angle so that
the images, after passing the double image prism, are
substantially in coincidence. In front of each of the objectives is
a mirror. The instrument points in the east and west line and the
mirrors are at 45° with its axis. One brings Polaris into the field,
the other by a motion of rotation about the telescope axis can
bring any object in or close to the meridian into the field alongside
Polaris. The images are then compared precisely as in the
preceding instance.<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> There are suitable adjustments for bringing
the images into the positions required.</p>

<p>The various forms of photometer using an artificial star as
intermediary in the comparison of real stars differ chiefly in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
method of varying the light in a determinate measure. Rather
the best known is the Zöllner instrument shown in diagram in
Fig. 149. Here <i>A</i> is the eye end of the main telescope tube.
Across it at an angle of 45° is thrown a piece of plane parallel
glass <i>B</i> which serves to reflect to the focus the beam from down
the side tube, <i>C</i>, forming the artificial star.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_195.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 149.</span>—Zöllner Photometer Diagram.</div>
</div>

<p>At the end of this tube is a small hole or more often a
diaphragm perforated with several very small holes any of
which can be brought into the axis of the tube. Beyond at <i>D</i>,
is the source of light, originally a lamp flame, now generally a
small incandescent lamp, with a ground glass disc or surface
uniformly to diffuse the light.</p>

<p>Within the tube <i>C</i> lie three Nicol prisms <i>n</i>, <i>n</i><sub>1</sub>, <i>n</i><sub>2</sub>. Of these <i>n</i>,
is fixed with respect to the mirror B and forms the analyser,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>which <i>n</i><sub>1</sub> and <i>n</i><sub>2</sub> turn together forming the polarizing system.
Between <i>n_1</i> and <i>n_2</i> is a quartz plate <i>e</i> cut perpendicular to the
crystal axis. The color of the light transmitted by such a plate
in polarized light varies through a wide range. By turning the
Nicol <i>n_2</i> therefore, the color of the beam which forms the artificial
star can be made to match the real star under examination,
and then by turning the whole system <i>n_2</i>, <i>E</i>, <i>n_1</i>, reading the
rotation on the divided circle at <i>F</i>, the real star can be matched
in intensity by the artificial one.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_196.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 150.</span>—Wedge Photometer.</div>
</div>
<p>This is viewed via the lens <i>G</i> and two tiny points of light
appear in the field of the ocular due respectively to reflection from
the front and back of the mirror <i>B</i>, the latter slightly fainter
than the former. Alongside or between these the real star image
can be brought for a comparison, and by turning the polarizer
through an angle [alpha] the images can be equalized with the real
image. Then a similar comparison is made with a reference
star. If A be the brightness of the former and B of the latter then</p>

<p class="center">A/B = sin²α/sin²<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>ββ</p>

<p>The Zöllner photometer was at first set up as an alt-azimuth
instrument with a small objective and rotation in altitude about
the axis <i>C</i>. Since the general use of electric lamps instead of the
inconvenient flame it is often fitted to the eye end of an equatorial.</p>

<p>Another very useful instrument is the modern wedge photometer,
closely resembling the Zöllner in some respects but with a
very different method of varying the light; devised by the late
Professor E. C. Pickering. It is shown somewhat in diagram in
Fig. 150. Here as before O is the eye end of the tube, B the plane
parallel reflector, C the side tube, L the source of light D the
diaphragm and A the lens forming the artificial star by projecting
the hole in the diaphragm. In actual practice the diameter of
such hole is 1/100 inch or less.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_197.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 151.</span>—Simple Polarizing Photometer.</div>
</div>

<p>The light varying device W is a “photographic wedge” set in a
frame which is graduated on the edge and moved in front of the
aperture by a rack and pinion at R. There are beside colored
and shade glasses for use as occasion requires. The “photographic
wedge” is merely a strip of fine grained photographic
plate given an evenly graduated exposure from end to end,
developed, and sealed under a cover glass. Its absorption is
permanent, non-selective as to color, and it can be made to shade
off from a barely perceptible density to any required opacity.
Sometimes a wedge of neutral tinted glass is used in its stead.</p>

<p>Before using such a “wedge photometer” the wedge must be
accurately calibrated by observation of real or artificial stars of
known difference in brightness. This is a task demanding much
care and is well described, together with the whole instrument<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
by Parkhurst (Ap. J. 13, 249). The great difficulty with all
instruments of this general type is the formation of an artificial
star the image of which shall very closely resemble the image
of the real star in appearance and color.</p>

<p>Obviously either the real or artificial star, or both, may be
varied in intensity by wedge or Nicols, and a very serviceable
modification of the Zöllner instrument, with this in mind was
recently described by Shook (Pop. Ast. 27, 595) and is shown
in diagram in Fig. 151. Here A is the tube which fits the ordinary
eyepiece sleeve. E is a side tube into which is fitted the extension
D with a fitting H at its outer end into which sets the lamp
tube G. This carries on a base plug F a small flash light bulb
run by a couple of dry cells. At O is placed a little brass diaphragm
perforated with a minute hole. Between this and the
lamp is a disc of diffusing glass or paper. A Nicol prism is set
a little ahead of O, and a lens L focusses the perforation at the
principal focus of the telescope after reflection from the diagonal
glass M, as in the preceding examples. I is an ordinary eyepiece
over which is a rotatable Nicol N with a position circle K.
At P is a third Nicol in the path of the rays from the real star,
thereby increasing the convenient range of the instrument.
The original paper gives the details of construction as well as
the methods of working. Obviously the same general arrangement
could be used for a wedge photometer using the wedge on
either real or artificial star or both.</p>

<p>The third type of visual photometer depends on reducing the
light of the star observed until it just disappears. This plan
was extensively employed by Professor Pritchard of Oxford some
40 years ago. He used a sliding wedge of dark glass, carefully
calibrated, and compared two stars by noting the point on the
wedge at which each was extinguished. A photographic wedge
may be used in exactly the same way.</p>

<p>Another device to the same end depends on reducing the
aperture of the telescope by a “cat’s eye,” an iris diaphragm, or
similar means until the star is no longer visible or just disappearing.
The great objection to such methods is the extremely
variable sensitivity of the eye under varying stimulus of light.</p>

<p>The most that can be said for the extinction photometer is
that in skillful and experienced hands like Pritchard’s it has
sometimes given much more consistent readings than would be
expected. It is now and then very convenient for quick approxi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>mation
but by no courtesy can it be considered an instrument of
precision either in astronomical or other photometry.<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>

<p>The photometer question should not be closed without referring
the reader to the methods of physical photometry as developed by
Stebbins, Guthnick and others. The first of these depends on
the use of the selenium cell in which the electrical resistance falls
on exposure of the selenium to light. The device is not one
adapted to casual use, and requires very careful nursing to give
the best results, but these are of an order of precision beyond
anything yet reached with an astronomical visual photometer.
Settings come down to variations of something like 2 per cent, and
variations in stellar light entirely escaping previous methods
become obvious.</p>

<p>The photoelectric cell depends on the lowering of the apparent
electric resistance of a layer of rarified inert gas between a platinum
grid and an electrode of metallic potassium or other alkali
metal when light falls on that electrode. The rate of transmission
of electricity is very exactly proportional to the illumination,
and can be best measured by a very sensitive electrometer.
The results are extraordinarily consistent, and the theoretical
“probable error” is very small, though here, as elsewhere,
“probable error” is a rather meaningless term apt to lead to a
false presumption of exactness. Again the apparatus is somewhat
intricate and delicate, but gives a precision of working if anything
a little better than that of the selenium cell, quite certainly
below 1 per cent.</p>

<p>Neither instrument constitutes an attachment to the ordinary
telescope of modest size which can be successfully used for ordinary
photometry, and both require reduction of results to the
basis of visual effect.<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> But both offer great promise in detecting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
minute variations of light and have done admirable work. For a
good fundamental description of the selenium cell photometer see
Stebbins, Ap. J. <b>32</b>, 185 and for the photoelectric method see
Guthnick A. N. <b>196</b>, 357 also A. F. and F. A. Lindemann,
M. N. <b>39</b>, 343. The volume by Miss Furness already referred
to gives some interesting details of both.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX</a><br />

<small>THE CARE AND TESTING OF TELESCOPES</small></h2>


<p>A word at the start concerning the choice and purchase of
telescopes. The question of refractors vs. reflectors has been
already considered. The outcome of the case depends on how
much and how often you are likely to use the instrument, and
just what you want it for. For casual observations and occasional
use—all that most busy buyers of telescopes can expect—the
refractor has a decided advantage in convenience. If one
has leisure for frequent observations, and particularly if he can
give his telescope a permanent mount, and is going in for serious
work, he will do well not to dismiss the idea of a reflector without
due deliberation.</p>

<p>In any case it is good policy to procure an instrument from one
of the best makers. And if you do not buy directly of the actual
maker it is best to deal with his accredited agents. In other
words avoid telescopes casually picked up in the optical trade
unless you chance to have facilities for thorough testing under
competent guidance before purchase. No better telescopes are
made than can be had from the best American makers. A few
British and German makers are quite in the same class. So few
high grade French telescopes reach this country as to cause a
rather common, but actually unjust,<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> belief that there are none.</p>

<p>If economy must be enforced it is much wiser to try to pick up a
used instrument of first class manufacture than to chance a new
one at a low price. Now and then a maker of very ordinary
repute may turn out a good instrument, but the fact is one to be
proved—not assumed. Age and use do not seriously deteriorate
a telescope if it has been given proper care. Some of Fraunhofer’s
are still doing good service after a century, and occasionally
an instrument from one of the great makers comes into the
market at a real bargain. It may drift back to the maker for
resale, or turn up at any optician’s shop, and in any case is better
worth looking at than an equally cheap new telescope.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span></p>

<p>The condition of the tube and stand cuts little figure if they are
mechanically in good shape. Most of the older high grade
instruments were of brass, beautifully finished and lacquered, and
nothing looks worse after hard usage. It is essential that the
fitting of the parts should be accurate and that the focussing rack
should work with the utmost smoothness. A fault just here,
however, can be remedied at small cost. The mount, whatever
its character, should be likewise smooth working and without a
trace of shakiness, unless one figures on throwing it away.</p>

<p>As to the objective, it demands very careful examination
before a real test of its optical qualities. The objective with its
cell should be taken out and closely scrutinized in a strong light
after the superficial dust has been removed with a camel’s
hair brush or by wiping very gently with the soft Japanese “lens
paper” used by opticians.</p>

<p>One is likely to find plenty to look at; spots, finger marks,
obvious scratches, and what is worse a network of superficial
scratches, or a surface with patches looking like very fine pitting.
These last two defects imply the need of repolishing the affected
surface, which means also more or less refiguring. Ordinary
brownish spots and finger marks can usually be removed with
little trouble.</p>

<p>The layman, so to speak, is often warned never to remove the
cell from a telescope but he might as well learn the simpler
adjustments first as last. In taking off a cell the main thing is to
see what one is about and to proceed in an orderly manner.
If the whole cell unscrews, as often is the case in small instruments,
the only precaution required is to put a pencil mark
on the cell and its seat so that it can be screwed back to where
it started.</p>

<p>If as is more usual the cell fits on with three pairs of screws, one
of each pair will form an abutment against which its mate pulls
the cell. A pencil mark locating the position of the head of each
of the pulling screws enables one to back them out and replace
them without shifting the cell.</p>

<p>The first inspection will generally tell whether the objective is
worth further trouble or not. If all surfaces save the front are in
good condition it may pay to send the objective to the maker for
repolishing. If more than one surface is in bad shape reworking
hardly pays unless the lens can be had for a nominal figure. In
buying a used instrument from its original source these precau<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>tions
are needless as the maker can be trusted to stand back of
his own and to put it in first class condition.</p>

<p>However, granted that the objective stands well the inspection
for superficial defects, it should then be given a real test for
figure and color correction, bearing in mind that objectives, even
from first class makers, may now and then show slightly faulty
corrections, while those from comparatively unknown sources
may now and then turn out well. In this matter of necessary
testing old and new glasses are quite on all fours save that one
may safely trust the maker with a well earned reputation to make
right any imperfections. Cleansing other than dusting off and
cautiously wiping with damp and then dry lens paper requires
removal of the lenses from their cell which demands real care.</p>

<p>With a promising looking objective, old or new, the first test
to be applied is the artificial star—artificial rather than natural
since the former stays put and can be used by day or by night.
For day use the “star” is merely the bright reflection of the sun
from a sharply curved surface—the shoulder of a small round
bottle, a spherical flask silvered on the inside, a small silvered
ball such as is used for Christmas tree decoration, a bicycle ball,
or a glass “alley” dear to the heart of the small boy.</p>

<p>The object, whatever it is, should be set up in the sun against
a dark background distant say 40 or 50 times the focal length of
the objective to be tested. The writer rather likes a silvered ball
cemented to a big sheet of black cardboard. At night a pin
hole say 1/32 inch or less in diameter through cardboard or
better, tinfoil, with a flame, or better a gas filled incandescent
lamp behind it, answers well. The latter requires rather careful
adjustment that the projected area of the closely coiled little
filament may properly fill the pinhole just in front of it.</p>

<p>Now if one sets up the telescope and focusses it approximately
with a low power the star can be accurately centered in the field.
Then if the eyepiece is removed, the tube racked in a bit, and
the eye brought into the focus of the objective, one can inspect
the objective for striæ. If these are absent the field will be
uniformly bright all over. Not infrequently however one will see
a field like Fig. 152 or Fig. 153. The former is the appearance of a
4 inch objective that the author recently got his eye upon. The
latter shows typical striæ of the ordinary sort. An objective of
glass as bad as shown in Fig. 152 gives no hope of astronomical
usefulness, and should be relegated to the porch of a seashore<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
cottage. Figure 153 may represent a condition practically
harmless though undesirable.</p>

<p>The next step is a really critical examination of the focal
image. Using a moderately high power ocular, magnifying say
50 to the inch of aperture, the star should be brought to the
sharpest focus possible and the image closely examined. If the
objective is good and in adjustment this image should be a very
small spot of light, perfectly round, softening very slightly in its
brilliancy toward the edge, and surrounded by two or three thin,
sharp, rings of light, exactly circular and with well defined dark
spaces separating them.</p>

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 153.</span>—Ordinary Striæ.</div>
</div>

<p>Often from the trembling of the air the rings will seem shaky
and broken, but still well centered on the star-disc. The general
appearance is that shown in Fig. 154.<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>

<div class="figleft">

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 154.</span>—A First Class
 Star Image.</div>
</div>

<p>Instead, several very different appearances may turn up.
First, the bright diffraction rings may be visible only on one
side of the central disc, which may itself be
drawn out in the same direction. Second,
the best image obtainable may be fairly
sharp but angular or irregular instead of
round or oval and perhaps with a hazy
flare on one side. Third, it may be impossible
to get a really sharp focus anywhere,
the image being a mere blob of light with nothing definite
about it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span></p>

<p>One should be very sure that the eyepiece is clean and without
fault before proceeding further. As to the first point a bit of
lens paper made into a tiny swab on a sliver of soft wood will be
of service, and the surfaces should be inspected with a pocket
lens in a good light to make sure that the cleaning has been
thorough. Turning the ocular round will show whether any
apparent defects of the image turn with it.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/i_205a.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 155.</span>—Effect of
Objective Askew.</div>
</div>

<p>In the first case mentioned the next step is to rack the ocular
gently out when the star image will expand into a more or less
concentric series of bright interference
rings separated by dark spaces, half a dozen
or so resulting from a rather small movement
out of focus. If these rings are out
of round and eccentric like Fig. 155 one
has a clear case of failure of the objective
to be square with the tube, so that the
ocular looks at the image askew.</p>

<p>In the ordinary forms of objective this means that the side of
the objective toward the brighter and less expanded part of the
ring system is too near the ocular. This can be remedied by
pushing that side of the objective outwards a trifle. Easing off
the pulling screw on that side and slightly tightening the abutment
screw makes the needed correction, which can be lessened
if over done at the first trial, until the ring system is accurately
centered. It is a rather fussy job but not at all difficult if one
remembers to proceed cautiously and to use the screw driver
gently.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i_205b.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 156.</span>—Effect of
Flaws in Objective.</div>
</div>

<p>In the second case, racking out the ocular a little gives a ring
system which exaggerates just the defects of
the image. The faults may be due to mechanical
strain of the objective in its cell,
which is easily cured, or to strains or flaws in
the glass itself, which are irremediable.
Therefore one should, with the plane of the
objective horizontal, loosen the retaining ring
that holds the lenses, without disturbing them,
and then set it back in gentle contact and try the out of focus
rings once more. If there is no marked improvement the fault
lies in the glass and no more time should be wasted on that
particular objective. Fig. 156 is a typical example of this fault.</p>

<p>In dealing with case three it is well to give the lens a chance by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
relieving it of any such mechanical strains, for now and then
they will apparently utterly ruin the definition, but the prognosis
is very bad unless the objective has been most brutally
mishandled.</p>

<p>In any case failure to give a sharply defined focus in a very
definite plane is a warning that the lens (or mirror) is rather bad.
In testing a reflector some pains must be taken at the start with
both the main and the secondary mirror. Using an artificial
star as before, one should focus and look sharply to the symmetry
of the image, taking care to leave the instrument in observing
position and screened from the sun for an hour or two before
testing. Reflectors are much more sensitive to temperature than
refractors and take longer to settle down to stability of figure.
With a well mounted telescope of either sort a star at fair altitude
on a fine night gives even better testing conditions than an
artificial star, (Polaris is good in northern latitudes) but one may
have a long wait.</p>

<p>If the reflector is of good figure and well adjusted, the star
image, in focus or out, has quite the same appearance as in a
refractor except that with a bright star in focus one sees a thin
sharp cross of light centered on the image, rather faint but
perfectly distinct. This is due to the diffraction effect of the
four thin strips that support the small
mirror, and fades as the star is put out of
focus.</p>

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 157.</span>—Extra-focal
Image from Reflector.</div>
</div>

<p>The rings then appear as usual, but also
a black disc due to the shadowing of the
small mirror. Fig. 157 shows the extra-focal
image of a real or artificial star when
the mirror is well centered, and the star in
the middle of the field. There only are
the rings round and concentric with the mirror spot. The rings
go out of round and the spot out of center for very small departure
from the middle of the field when the mirror is of large relative
aperture—F/5 or F/6.</p>

<p>If the star image shows flare or oval out-of-focus rings when
central of the field, one or both mirrors probably need adjustment.
Before laying the trouble to imperfect figure, the mirrors
should be adjusted, the small one first as the most likely source
of trouble. The side of the mirror toward which the flare or the
expanded side of the ring system projects should be slightly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
pushed away from the ocular. (Note that owing to the reflection
this movement is the reverse of that required with a
refractor.)</p>

<p>If the lack of symmetry persists one may as well get down to
first principles and center the mirrors at once. Perhaps the
easiest plan is to prepare a disc of white cardboard exactly the
size of the mirror with concentric circles laid out upon it and an
eighth inch hole in the center. Taking out the ocular and putting
a half inch stop in its place one can stand back, lining up the stop
with the draw tube, and see whether the small mirror looks
perfectly round and is concentric with the reflected circles. If
not, a touch of the adjusting screws will be needed.</p>

<p>Then with a fine pointed brush dot the center of the mirror
itself through the hole, with white paint. Then, removing the
card, one will see this dot accurately centered in the small mirror
if the large one is in adjustment, and it remains as a permanent
reference point. If the dot be eccentric it can be treated as
before, but by the adjusting screws of the large mirror.</p>

<p>The final adjustment can then be made by getting a slightly
extra-focal star image fairly in the center of the field with a
rather high power and making the system concentric as before
described. This sounds a bit complicated but it really is not.
If the large mirror is not in place, its counter cell may well be
centered and levelled by help of a plumb line from the center of
the small mirror and a steel square, as a starting point, the small
mirror having been centered as nearly as may be by measurement.<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

<p>So much for the general adjustment of the objective or mirror.
Its actual quality is shown only on careful examination.</p>

<p>As a starting point one may take the extra-focal system of rings
given by an objective or mirror after proper centering. If the
spherical aberration has thoroughly removed the appearance of
the rings when expanded so that six or eight are visible should be
like Fig. 158. The center should be a sharply defined bright
point and surrounding it, and exactly concentric, should be the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
interference rings, truly circular and gradually increasing in
intensity outwards, the last being very noticeably the strongest.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i_208a.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 158.</span>—Correct Extra-focal Image.</div>
</div>

<p>One can best make the test when looking through a yellow
glass screen which removes the somewhat confusing flare due to
imperfect achromatism and makes the appearances inside and
outside focus closely similar.
Just inside or outside of focus
the appearance should be that
of Fig. 159 for a perfectly corrected
objective or mirror.</p>

<p>Sometimes an objective will be
found in which one edge of the
focussed star image is notably
red and the opposite one tinted
with greenish or bluish, showing unsymmetrical coloring, still
more obvious when the image is put a little out of focus. This
means that the optical centers of crown and flint are out of line
from careless edging of the lenses or very bad fitting. The case
is bad enough to justify trying the only remedy available outside
the optician’s workshop—rotating one lens upon the other and thus
trying the pair in different relative azimuths.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/i_208b.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 159.</span>—Correct Image Just
Out of Focus.</div>
</div>

<p>The initial positions of the pair must be marked plainly, care
must be taken not to displace the spacers 120° apart often found
at the edges of the lenses, and the
various positions must be tried in
an orderly manner. One not infrequently
finds a position in which
the fault is negligible or disappears
altogether, which point should be
at once marked for reference.</p>

<p>In case there is uncorrected
spherical aberration there is departure
from regular gradation of brightness in the rings. If
there is a “short edge,” <i>i.e.</i>, + spherical aberration, so that rays
from the outer zone come to a focus too short, the edge ring will
look too strong within focus, and the inner rings relatively weak;
with this appearance reversed outside focus. A “long edge” <i>i.e.</i>,
- spherical aberration, shows the opposite condition, edge rings
too strong outside focus and too weak within. Both are rather
common faults. The “long edge” effect is shown in Figs. 160
and 161, as taken quite close to focus.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span></p>

<p>It takes a rather sharp eye and considerable experience to
detect small amounts of spherical aberration; perhaps the best
way of judging is in quickly passing from just inside to just outside
focus and back again, using a yellow screen and watching
very closely for variations in brightness. Truth to tell a small
amount of residual aberration, like that of Fig. 160, is not a
serious matter as regards actual performance—it hurts the
telescopist’s feelings much more than the quality of his images.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_209.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 160.</span>—Spherical Aberration Just Inside Focus.<br />
<span class="smcap">Fig. 161.</span>—Spherical Aberration Just Outside Focus.</div>
</div>

<p>A much graver fault is zonal aberration, where some intermediate
zone of objective or mirror comes to a focus too long or
too short, generally damaging the definition rather seriously,
depending on the amount of variation in focus of the faulty zone.
A typical case is shown in Fig. 162 taken within focus. Here
two zones are abnormally strong showing, just as in the case of
simple spherical aberration, too short focus. Outside of focus
the intensities would change places, the outer and midway zones
and center being heavy, and the strong zones of Fig. 162 weak.
These zonal aberrations are easily detected and are rather common
both in objectives and mirrors, though rarely as conspicuous
as in Fig. 162.</p>

<p>Another failing is the appearance of astigmatism, which,
broadly, is due to a refracting or reflecting surface which is not
a surface of revolution and therefore behaves differently for
rays incident in different planes around its optical axis. In its
commonest form the surface reflects or refracts more strongly
along one plane than along another at right angles to it. Hence
the two have different foci and there is no point focus at all,
but two line foci at right angles. Figs. 163 and 164 illustrate
this fault, the former being taken inside and the latter outside
focus, under fairly high power. If a star image is oval and the
major axis of this oval has turned through 90° when one passes to
the other side of focus, astigmatism is somewhere present.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span></p>

<p>As more than half of humanity is astigmatic, through fault of
the eye, one should twist the axis of the eyes some 90° around the
axis of the telescope and look again. If the axis of the oval has
turned with the eyes a visit to the oculist is in order. If not, it is
worth while rotating the ocular. If the oval does not turn with it
that particular telescope requires reworking before it can be of
much use.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i_210a.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 162.</span>—A Case of Zonal
 Aberration.</div>
</div>

<p>This astigmatism due to fault of figure must not be confused
with the astigmatic difference of the
image surfaces referred to in Chapter
IV which is zero on the axis and not
of material importance in ordinary
telescopes. Astigmatism of figure on
the contrary is bad everywhere and
always. It should be especially looked
out for in reflecting surfaces, curved
or plane, since it is a common result
of flexure.</p>

<p>Passing on now from these simple tests for figure, chromatic
aberration has to be examined. Nothing is better than an
artificial star formed by the sun in daylight, for the preliminary
investigation. At night Polaris is advantageous for this as for
other tests.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_210b.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 163.</span>—Astigmatism Inside Focus.
<br /><span class="smcap">Fig. 164.</span>—Astigmatism Outside Focus.</div>
</div>

<p>The achromatization curves, Fig. 163, really tell the whole story
of what is to be seen. When the telescope is carefully focussed
for the bright part of the spectrum, getting the sharpest star
image attainable, the central disc, small and clean, should be
yellowish white, seen under a power of 60 or 70 per inch of
aperture.</p>

<p>But the red and blue rays have a longer focus and hence rim
the image with a narrow purplish circle varying slightly in hue
according to the character of the achromatization. Pushing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
the ocular a little inside, focus, the red somewhat overbalances
the blue and the purple shades toward the red. Pulling out the
ocular very slightly one brings the deep red into focus as a minute
central red point, just as the image begins to expand a little.
Further outside focus a bluish or purplish flare fills the center of
the field, while around it lies a greenish circle due to the rays
from the middle of the secondary spectrum expanding from
their shorter focus.</p>

<p>In an under-corrected objective this red point is brighter and
the fringe about the image, focussed or within focus, is conspicuously
reddish. Heavy overcorrection gives a strong bluish
fringe and the red point is dull or absent. With a low power ocular,
unless it be given a color correction of its own, any properly corrected
objective will seem under-corrected as already explained.</p>

<p>The color correction can also be well examined by using an
ocular spectroscope like Fig. 140, with the cylindrical lens
removed. Examining the focussed star image thus, the spectrum
is a narrow line for the middle color of the secondary spectrum,
widening equally at F and B, and expanding into a sort of brush
at the violet end. Conversely, when moved outside focus until
the width is reduced to a narrow line at F and B, the widening
toward the yellow and green shows very clearly the nature and
extent of the secondary spectrum. In this way too, the actual
foci for the several colors can easily be measured.</p>

<p>The exact nature of the color correction is somewhat a matter
of taste and of the uses for which the telescope is designed, but
most observers agree in the desirability of the B-F correction
commonly used as best balancing the errors of eye and ocular.
With reflectors, achromatic or even over-corrected oculars are
desirable. The phenomena in testing a telescope for color
vary with the class of star observed—the solar type is a good
average. Trying a telescope on [alpha] Lyræ emphasizes unduly the
blue phases, while [alpha] Orionis would overdo the red.</p>

<p>The simple tests on star discs in and out of focus here described
are ample for all ordinary purposes, and a glass which passes
them well is beyond question an admirably figured one. The
tests are not however quantitative, and it takes an experienced
eye to pick out quickly minor errors, which are somewhat irregular.
One sometimes finds the ring system excellent but a sort of
haze in the field, making the contrasts poor—bad polish or dirt,
but figure good.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span></p>

<p>A test found very useful by constructors or those with laboratory
facilities is the knife edge test, worked out chiefly by Foucault
and widely used in examining specula. It consists in
principle of setting up the mirror so as to bring the rays to the
sharpest possible focus. For instance in a spherical mirror a
lamp shining through a pin hole is placed in the centre of curvature,
and the reflected image is brought just alongside it where it
can be inspected by eye or eyepiece. In Fig. 165 all the rays
which emanate from the pinhole <i>b</i> and fall on the mirror a are
brought quite exactly to focus at <i>c</i>. The eye placed close to <i>c</i>
will see, if the mirror surface is perfect, a uniform disc of light
from the mirror.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_212a.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 165.</span>—The Principle of the Foucault Test.</div>
</div>

<p>If now a knife edge like <i>d</i>, say a safety razor blade, be very
gradually pushed through the focus the light will be cut off in
a perfectly uniform manner—no zone or local spot going first.
If some error in the surface at any point causes the reflected ray
to miss the focus and cross ahead of or behind it as in the ray
<i>bef</i>, then the knife edge will catch it first or last as the case may
be, and the spot <i>e</i> will be first darkened or remain bright after
the light elsewhere is extinguished.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_212b.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 166.</span>—Foucault Test of Parabolic Mirror.</div>
</div>

<p>One may thus explore the surface piecemeal and detect not
only zones but slight variations in the same zone with great
precision. In case of a parabolic mirror as in Fig. 166 the test<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
is made at the focus by aid of the auxiliary plane mirror, and a
diagonal as shown, the pinhole and knife edge being arranged
quite as before. A very good description of the practical use of
the knife edge test may be found in the papers of Dr. Draper and
Mr. Ritchey already cited.</p>

<p>It is also applied to refractors, in which case monochromatic
light had better be used, and enables the experimenter to detect
even the almost infinitesimal markings sometimes left by the
polishing tool, to say nothing of slight variations in local figure
which are continually lost in the general illumination about the
field when one uses the star test in the ordinary manner.</p>

<p>The set-up for the knife edge experiments should be very steady
and smooth working to secure precise results, and it therefore is
not generally used save in the technique of figuring mirrors, where
it is invaluable. With micrometer motions on the knife edge,
crosswise and longitudinally, one can make a very exact diagnosis
of errors of figure or flexure.</p>

<p>A still more delicate method of examining the perfection of
figuring is found in the Hartmann test. (Zeit. fur Instk.,
1904, 1909). This is essentially a photographic test, comparing
the effect of the individual zones of the objective inside and outside
of focus. Not only are the effects of the zones compared but
also the effects of different parts of the same zone, so that any lack
of symmetry in performance can be at once found and measured.</p>

<p>The Hartmann test is shown diagrammatically in Fig. 167.
The objective is set up for observing a natural or artificial star.
Just in front of it is placed an opaque screen perforated with
holes, as shown in section by Fig. 167, where A is the perforated
screen. The diameters of the holes are about 1/20 the diameter of
the objective as the test is generally applied, and there are
usually four holes 90° apart for each zone. And such holes are
not all in one line, but are distributed symmetrically about the
screen, care being taken that each zone shall be represented by
holes separated radially and also tangentially, corresponding to
the pairs of elements in the two astigmatic image surfaces, an
arrangement which enables the astigmatism as well as figure to
be investigated.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_214.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"> <span class="smcap">Fig. 167.</span>—The Principle of the Hartmann Test.</div>
</div>

<p>The arrangement of holes actually found useful is shown in
Hartmann’s original papers, and also in a very important paper by
Plaskett (Ap. J. <i>25</i> 195) which contains the best account in
English of Hartmann’s methods and their application. Now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a><br /><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
each hole in the screen transmits a pencil of light through the
objective at the corresponding point, and each pencil comes to a
focus and then diverges, the foci being distributed somewhere in
the vicinity of what one may regard as the principal focus, <i>B</i>.
For instance in Fig. 167 are shown five pairs of apertures <i>a</i>, <i>a′</i>,
<i>b</i>, <i>b′</i>, etc., in five different zones. Now if a photographic plate
be exposed a few inches inside focus as at C each pencil from an
aperture in the screen will be represented by a dot on the photograph,
at such distance from the axis and from the corresponding
dot on the other side of the axis as the respective inclinations of
the pencils of light may determine.</p>

<p>Similarly a plate exposed at approximately equal distance on
the other side of the general focus, as at <i>D</i>, will show a pattern of
dots due to the distribution of the several rays at a point beyond
focus. Now if all the pencils from the several apertures met at
a common focus in <i>B</i>, the two patterns on the plates <i>C</i> and <i>D</i>
would be exactly alike and for equal distance away from focus of
exactly the same size. In general the patterns will not exactly
correspond, and the differences measured with the micrometer
show just how much any ray in question has departed from
meeting at an exact common focus with its fellows.</p>

<p>For instance in the cut it will be observed that the rays <i>e</i> and
<i>a′</i> focus barely beyond <i>C</i> and by the time they reach <i>D</i> are well
spread apart. The relative distance of the dots upon these
corresponding plates, with the distance between the plates, shows
exactly at what point between <i>C</i> and <i>D</i> these particular rays
actually did cross and come to a focus.</p>

<p>Determining this is merely a matter of measuring up similar
triangles, for the path of the rays is straight. Similarly inspection
will show that the rays <i>d</i> and <i>d′</i> meet a little short of <i>B</i>, and
measurement of their respective records on the plates <i>C</i> and <i>D</i>
would show the existence of a zone intermediate in focus between
the focus of <i>e,e′</i> and the general focus at <i>B</i>. The exact departure
of this zone from correct focus can therefore be at once measured.</p>

<p>A little further examination discloses the fact that the outer
zone represented by the rays <i>a,b</i>, and <i>a′,b′</i> has not quite the same
focus at the two extremities of the same diameter of the objective.
In other words the lens is a little bit flatter at one end of this
diameter than it is at the other, so that the rays here have considerably
longer focus than they should, a fault by no means
unknown although fortunately not very common.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span></p>

<p>It will be seen that the variations between the two screen
patterns on <i>C</i> and <i>D</i>, together with the difference between them,
give accurately the performance of each point of the objective
represented by an aperture in the screen. And similar investigations
by substantially the same method may be extended to the
astigmatic variations, to the general color correction, and to the
difference in the aberrations for the several colors. The original
papers cited should be consulted for the details of applying this
very precise and interesting test.</p>

<p>It gives an invaluable record of the detailed corrections of an
objective, and while it is one with which the ordinary observer
has little concern there are times when nothing else can give with
equal precision the necessary record of performance. There
are divers other tests used for one purpose or another in examining
objectives and mirrors, but those here described are ample
for nearly all practical purposes, and indeed the first two commonly
disclose all that it is necessary to know.</p>

<p>Now and then one has to deal with an objective which is
unmitigatedly dirty. It can be given a casual preliminary cleaning
in the way already mentioned, but sometimes even this will
not leave it in condition for testing. Then one must get down
to the bottom of things and make a thorough job of it.</p>

<p>The chief point to remember in undertaking this is that the
thing which one is cleaning is glass, and very easy to scratch if
one rubs dust into it, but quite easy to clean if one is careful.
The second thing to be remembered is that once cleaned it must
be replaced as it was before and not in some other manner.</p>

<p>The possessor of a dirty objective is generally advised to take
it to the maker or some reliable optician. If the maker is handy,
or an optician of large experience in dealing with telescope
objectives is available, the advice is good, but there is no difficulty
whatever in cleaning an objective with the exercise of that
ordinary care which the user of a telescope may be reasonably
expected to possess.</p>

<p>It is a fussy job, but not difficult, and the best advice as to how
to clean a telescope objective is to “tub” it, literally, if beyond
the stage where the superficial wiping described is sufficient.</p>

<p>To go about the task one first sets down the objective in its
cell on a horizontal surface and removes the screws that hold in
the retaining ring, or unscrews the ring itself as the case may be.
This leaves the cell and objective with the latter uppermost and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
free to be taken out. Prepare on a table a pad of anything soft,
a little smaller than the objective, topping the pad with soft
and clean old cloth; then, raising up the cell at an edge, slip the
two thumbs under it and lay the fingers lightly on the outer lens
of the objective, then invert the whole affair upon the pad and
lift off the cell, leaving the objective on its soft bed.</p>

<p>Before anything else is done the edge of the objective should
be marked with a hard lead pencil on the edge of both the component
lenses, making two well defined v’s with their points
touching. Also, if, as usual, there are three small separators
between the edges of the flint and crown lenses, mark the position
of each of these 1, 2, 3, with the same pencil.</p>

<p>Forming another convenient pad of something soft, lift off the
upper lens, take out the three separators and lay them in order
on a sheet of paper without turning them upside down. Mark
alongside each, the serial number denoting its position. Then
when these spacers, if in good condition, are put back, they will
go back in the same place rightside up, and the objective itself
will go back into place unchanged.</p>

<p>Now have at hand a wooden or fibre tub or basin which has
been thoroughly washed out with soap and water and wiped
dry. Half fill it with water slightly lukewarm and with a good
mild toilet soap, shaving soap for example, with clean hands and
very soft clean cloth, go at one of the lenses and give it a thorough
washing. After this it should be rinsed very thoroughly and
wiped dry. As to material for wiping, the main thing is that it
must be soft and free from dust that will scratch. Old handkerchiefs
serve a good turn.</p>

<p>Dr. Brashear years ago in describing this process recommended
cheese cloth. The present day material that goes under this
name is far from being as soft at the start as it ought to be, and
only the best quality of it should be used, and then only after
very thorough soaking, rinsing and drying. The very soft towels
used for cleaning cut glass, if washed thoroughly clean and kept
free from dust, answer perfectly well. The cheese cloth has the
advantage of being comparatively cheap so that it can be thrown
away after use. Whatever the cloth, it should be kept, after
thorough washing and drying, in a closed jar.</p>

<p>Rinsing the lens thoroughly and wiping it clean and dry is the
main second stage of cleansing. It sometimes will be found to be
badly spotted in a way which this washing will not remove.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
Sometimes the spotting will yield to alcohol carefully rubbed
on with soft absorbent cotton or a bunch of lens paper.</p>

<p>If alcohol fails the condition of the surface is such as to justify
trying more strenuous means. Nitric acid of moderate strength
rubbed on with a swab of absorbent cotton will sometimes clear
up the spotting. If this treatment be used it should be followed
up with a 10 per cent solution of pure caustic potash or moderately
strong c.p. ammonia and then by very thorough rinsing.
Glass will stand without risk cautious application of both acid
and alkali, but the former better than the latter.</p>

<p>Then a final rinsing and drying is in order. Many operators
use a final washing with alcohol of at least 90 per cent strength
which is allowed to evaporate with little or no wiping. Alcohol
denatured with methyl alcohol serves well if strong enough but
beware denatured alcohol of unknown composition. Others
have used petroleum naphtha and things of that sort. At the
present time these commercial petroleum products are extremely
uncertain in quality, like gasoline, being obtained, Heaven knows
how, from the breaking down of heavier petroleum products.</p>

<p>If pure petroleum ether can be obtained it answers quite as
well as alcohol, but unless the volatile fluid is pure it may leave
streaks. Ordinarily neither has to be used, as after the proper
wiping the glass comes perfectly clean. This done the glass can
be replaced on the pad whence it came and its mate put through
the same process.</p>

<p>Flint glass is more liable to spot than the crown, but the crown
is by no means immune against the deterioration of the surface,
perhaps incipient devitrification, and during the war many
objectives “went blind” from unexplained action of this character.
As a rule the soap and water treatment applied with care
leaves even a pretty hard looking specimen of objective in
fairly good condition except for the scratches which previous
users have put upon it.</p>

<p>Then if the spacing pieces, usually of tinfoil, are not torn or
corroded they can be put back into place, the one lens superimposed
upon the other, and the pair put back into the cell by
dropping it gently over them and re-inverting the whole, taking
care this time to have soft cloth or lens paper under the fingers.
Then the retaining ring can be put into place again and the
objective is ready for testing or use as the case may be.</p>

<p>If the spacers are corroded or damaged it may be necessary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
to replace them with very thin tinfoil cut the same size and shape,
leaving however a little extra length to turn down over the edge
of the lower lens. They are fastened in place on the extreme
edge only by the merest touch of mucilage, shellac or Canada balsam,
whichever comes to hand. The one important thing is that
the spacers should be entirely free of the sticky material where
they lap over the edge of the lens to perform the separation.
This lap is generally not over 1/16 of an inch, not enough to show
at the outside of the objective when it is in its cell. When the
upper lens is lightly pressed down into place, after the gum or
shellac is dry, all the projecting portion can be trimmed away
with a sharp pen-knife leaving simply the spacers in the appointed
places from which the original ones were removed.</p>

<p>Some little space has been given to this matter of cleaning
objectives, as in many situations objectives accumulate dirt
rather rapidly and it is highly desirable for the user to learn how
to perform the simple but careful task of cleansing them.</p>

<p>In ordinary use, when dirt beyond the reach of mere dusting
with a camel’s hair brush has stuck itself to the exterior of an
objective, a succession of tufts of absorbent cotton or wads of
lens paper at first dampened with pure water or alcohol and then
followed lightly, after the visible dirt has been gently mopped up,
by careful wiping with the same materials, will keep the exterior
surface in good condition, the process being just that suggested
in the beginning of this chapter as the ordinary cleaning up preparatory
to a thorough examination.</p>

<p>The main thing to be avoided in the care of a telescope, aside
from rough usage generally, is getting the objective wet and then
letting it take its chances of drying. In many climates dew is a
very serious enemy and the customary dew cap three or four
diameters long, bright on the outside and blackened within, is of
very great service in lessening the deposit of dew upon the glass.
Also the dew cap keeps out much stray light that might otherwise
do mischief by brightening the general field. In fact its function
as a light-trap is very important especially if it is materially
larger in diameter than the objective and provided with stops.</p>

<p>The finder should be similarly protected, otherwise it will
mysteriously go blind in the middle of an evening’s work due
to a heavy deposit of moisture on the objective. The effect
is an onset of dimness and bad definition which is altogether
obnoxious.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span></p>

<p>As regards the metal parts of a telescope they should be treated
like the metal parts of any other machine, while the moving
parts require from time to time a little touch of sperm or similar
oil like every other surface where friction may occur.</p>

<p>The old fashioned highly polished and lacquered brass tube
was practically impossible to keep looking respectably well
provided it was really used to any considerable extent. About
the most that could be done to it was dusting when dusty, and
cautiously and promptly wiping off any condensed moisture.
The more modern lacquered tubes require very little care and if
they get in really bad condition can be relacquered without much
expense or difficulty.</p>

<p>Wooden tubes, occasionally found in old instruments, demand
the treatment which is accorded to other highly finished wooden
things, occasional rubbing with oil or furniture polish according
to the character of the original surface. Painted tubes may
occasionally require a fresh coat, which it does not require great
skill to administer. If the surface of wooden tripods comes to
be in bad shape it needs the oil or polish which would be accorded
to other well finished wooden articles.</p>

<p>Mountings are usually painted or lacquered and either surface
can be renewed eventually at no great trouble. Bright parts
may be lightly touched with oil as an ordinary rust preventive.</p>

<p>Reflecting telescopes are considerably more troublesome to
keep in order than refractors owing to the tender nature of the
silvered surface. It may remain in good condition with fairly
steady use for several years or it may go bad in a few months or a
few weeks. The latter is not an unusual figure in telescopes
used about a city where smoke is plentiful. The main thing is
to prevent the deposit of dew on the mirror, or getting it wet in
any other way, for in drying off the drops almost invariably
leave spots.</p>

<p>Many schemes have been proposed for the prevention of injury
to the mirror surface. A close fitting metal cover, employed
whenever the mirror is not in use, has given good results in many
places. Where conditions are extreme this is sometimes lined
with a layer of dry absorbent cotton coming fairly down upon
the mirror surface, and if this muffler is dry, clean, and a little
warmer than the mirror when put on, it seems to be fairly
effective. Preferably the mirror should be kept, when not in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
use, at a little higher temperature than the surrounding air so
that dew will not tend to deposit upon it.</p>

<p>As to actual protective measures the only thing that seems
to be really efficient is a very thin coating of lacquer, first tried by
Perot at the Paris Observatory. The author some ten years
since took up the problem in protecting some laboratory mirrors
against fumes and moisture and found that the highest grade of
white lacquer, such as is used for the coating of fine silverware in
the trade, answered admirably if diluted with six or eight volumes
of the thinner sold with such commercial lacquers. It is best to
thin the lacquer to the requisite amount and then filter.</p>

<p>If now a liberal amount of the mixture is poured upon the
mirror surface after careful dusting, swished quickly around,
and the mirror is then immediately turned up on edge to drain
and dry, a very thin layer of lacquer will be left upon it, only a
fraction of a wave length thick, so that it shows broad areas of
interference colors.</p>

<p>Treated in this way and kept dry the coating will protect the
brilliancy of the silver for a good many months even under rather
unfavorable circumstances. After trying out the scheme rather
thoroughly the treatment was applied to the 24 inch reflector of
the Harvard Observatory and has been in use ever since. The
author applied the first coating in the spring of 1913, and since
that time it has only been necessary to resilver perhaps once in
six months as against about as many weeks previously.</p>

<p>The lacquer used in this case was the so-called “Lastina”
lacquer made by the Egyptian Lacquer Company of New York,
but there are doubtless others of similar grade in the market.
It is a collodion lacquer and in recent years it has proved desirable
to use as a thinner straight commercial amylacetate rather than
the thinner usually provided with the lacquer, perhaps owing to
the fact that difficulty of obtaining materials during the war
may have caused, as in so many other cases, substitutions which,
while perfectly good for the original purpose did not answer so
well under the extreme conditions required in preserving telescope
mirrors.</p>

<p>The lacquer coating when thinned to the extent here recommended
does not apparently in any way deteriorate the definition
as some years of regular work at Harvard have shown. Some
experimenters have, however, found difficulty, quite certainly
owing to using too thick a lacquer. The endurance of a lacquer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
coating where the mirror is kept free from moisture, and
its power to hold the original brilliancy of the surface is very
extraordinary.</p>

<p>The writer took out and tested one laboratory mirror coated
seven years before, and kept in a dry place, and found the
reflecting power still a little above .70, despite the fact that the
coating was so dry as to be almost powdery when touched with a
tuft of cotton. At the start the mirror had seen some little use
unprotected and its reflection coefficient was probably around .80.
If the silver coating is thick as it can be conveniently made, on a
well coated mirror, the coat of lacquer, when tarnish has begun,
can be washed off with amylacetate and tufts of cotton until the
surface is practically clear of it, and the silver itself repolished
by the ordinary method and relacquered.</p>

<p>There are many silvering processes in use and which one
should be chosen for re-silvering a mirror, big or little, is quite
largely a matter of individual taste, and more particularly experience.
The two most used in this country are those of Dr.
Brashear and Mr. Lundin, head of the Alvan Clark Corporation,
and both have been thoroughly tried out by these experienced
makers of big mirrors.</p>

<p>The two processes differ in several important particulars but
both seem to work very successfully. The fundamental thing
in using either of them is that the glass surface to be silvered
should be chemically clean. The old silver, if a mirror is being
resilvered, is removed with strong nitric acid which is very
thoroughly rinsed off after every trace of silver has been removed.
Sometimes a second treatment with nitric acid may advantageously
follow the first with more rinsing. The acid should be
followed by a 10 per cent solution of c.p. caustic potash (some
operators use c.p. ammonia as easier to clear away) rinsed off
with the utmost thoroughness.</p>

<p>On general principles the last rinsing should be with distilled
water and the glass surface should not be allowed to dry between
this rinsing and starting the silvering process, but the whole
mirror should be kept under water until the time for silvering.
In Dr. Brashear’s process the following two solutions are made
up; first the reducing solution as follows:</p>


<ul><li>Rock candy, 20 parts by weight.</li>
<li>Strong nitric acid (spec. gr. 1.22), 1 part.</li>
<li>Alcohol, 20 parts.</li>
<li><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span></li>
<li>Distilled water, 200 parts.</li>
</ul>

<p>This improves by keeping and if this preparation has to be
hurried the acid, sugar and distilled water should be boiled
together and then the alcohol added after the solution is cooled.</p>

<p>Second, make up the silvering solution in three distinct portions;
first the silver solution proper as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>1. 2 parts silver nitrate. 20 parts distilled water.</li>
<li>Second, the alkali solution as follows:</li>
<li>2. 1⅓ parts c.p. caustic potash. 20 parts distilled water.</li>
<li>Third, the reserve silver solution as follows:</li>
<li>3. &frac14; part silver nitrate. 16 parts distilled water.</li>
</ul>


<p>The working solution of silver is then prepared thus: Gradually
add to the silver solution No. 1 the strongest ammonia, slowly
and with constant stirring. At first the solution will turn dark
brown and then it will gradually clear up. Ammonia should be
added only just to the point necessary to clear the solution.</p>

<p>Then add No. 2, the alkali solution. Again the mixture will
turn dark brown and must be cautiously cleared once more with
ammonia until it is straw colored but clear of precipitate.
Finally add No. 3, the reserve solution, very cautiously with
stirring until the solution grows darker and begins to show traces
of suspended matter which will not stir out. Then filter the
whole through absorbent cotton to free it of precipitate and it is
ready for use. One is then ready for the actual silvering.</p>

<p>Now there are two ways of working the process, with the
mirror face up, or face down. The former is advantageous in
allowing better inspection of the surface as it forms, and also it
permits the mirror of a telescope to be silvered without removing
it from the cell, as was in fact done habitually in case of the big
reflector of the Alleghany Observatory where the conditions
were such as to demand re-silvering once a month. The solution
was kept in motion during the process by rocking the telescope
as a whole.</p>

<p>When silvering face up the mirror is made to form the bottom
of the silvering vessel, being fitted with a wrapping of strong
paraffined or waxed paper or cloth, wound several times around
the rim of the mirror and carried up perhaps half the thickness
of the mirror to form a retainer for the silvering solution. This
band is firmly tied around the edge of the mirror making a water
tight joint. Ritchey uses a copper band fitted to the edge of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
the mirror and drawn tight by screws, and finishes making
tight with paraffin and a warm iron.</p>

<p>In silvering face down the mirror is suspended a little distance
above the bottom of a shallow dish, preferably of earthen ware,
containing the solution. Various means are used for supporting
it. Thus cleats across the back cemented on with hard optician’s
pitch answer well for small mirrors, and sometimes special
provision is made for holding the mirror by the extreme edge in
clamps.</p>

<p>Silvering face down is in some respects less convenient but
does free the operator from the very serious trouble of the heavy
sediment which is deposited from the rather strong silver solution.
This is the essential difficulty of the Brashear process in silvering
face up. The trouble may be remedied by very gentle swabbing
of the surface under the liquid with absorbent cotton, from the
time when the silver coating begins fairly to form until it is
completed.</p>

<p>The Brashear process is most successfully worked at a temperature
between 65° and 70° F. and some experience is required
to determine the exact proportion of the reducing solution to be
added to the silvering solution. Ritchey advises such quantity
of the reducing solution as contains of sugar one-half the total
weight of the silver nitrate used. The total amount of solution
after mixing should cover the mirror about an inch deep. Too
much increases the trouble from sediment and fails to give a
clean coating. The requisite quantity of reducing solution is
poured into the silvering solution and then immediately, if the
mirror is face up, fairly upon it, without draining it of the water
under which it has been standing.</p>

<p>If silvering face down the face will have been immersed in a
thin layer of distilled water and the mixed solutions are poured
into the dish. In either case the solution is rocked and kept
moving pretty thoroughly until the process is completed which
will take about five minutes. If silvering is continued too long
there is likelihood of an inferior whitish outer surface which will
not polish well, but short of this point the thicker the coat the
better, since a thick coat stands reburnishing where a thin one
does not and moreover the thin one may be thin enough to
transmit some valuable light.</p>

<p>When the silvering is done the solution should be rapidly
poured off, the edging removed or the mirror lifted out of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
solution, rinsed off first with tap water and then with distilled,
and swabbed gently to clear the remaining sediment. Then the
mirror can be set up on edge to dry. A final flowing with alcohol
and the use of a fan hastens the process.</p>

<p>In Lundin’s method the initial cleaning process is the same but
after the nitric acid has been thoroughly rinsed off the surface is
gently but thoroughly rubbed with a saturated solution of tin
chloride, applied with a wad of absorbent cotton. After the
careful rubbing the tin chloride solution must be washed off
with the utmost thoroughness, preferably with moderately warm
water. It is just as important to get off the tin chloride completely,
as it is to clean completely the mirror surface by its use.
Otherwise streaks may be left where the silvering will not take
well.</p>

<p>When the job has been properly done one can wet the whole
surface with a film of water and it will stay wet even when the
surface is slightly tilted. As in the Brashear process the mirror
must be kept covered with water. Mr. Lundin always silvers
large mirrors face up, and forms the dish by wrapping around the
edge of the mirror a strip of bandage cloth soaked in melted
beeswax and smoothed off by pulling it while still hot between
metal rods to secure even distribution of the wax so as to make a
water tight joint. This rim of cloth is tied firmly around the
edge of the mirror and the strings then wet to draw them
still tighter.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the water should cover the mirror by &frac34; of an inch
or more. It is to be noted that in the Lundin process ordinary
water is usually found just as efficient as distilled water, but it is
hardly safe to assume that such is the case, without trying it out
on a sample of glass.</p>

<p>There are then prepared two solutions, a silver solution,<br />

<span class="i4">2.16 parts silver nitrate (see King, Pop. Ast <b>30</b>, 93)</span><br />

<span class="i4">100 parts water.</span><br />

and a reducing solution,<br />

<span class="i4">4 parts Merck’s formaldehyde</span><br />

<span class="i4">20 parts water.</span></p>


<p>This latter quantity is used for each 100 parts of the above silver
solution, and the whole quantity made up is determined by the
amount of liquid necessary to cover the mirror as just described.</p>

<p>The silver solution is cautiously and completely cleared up by
strong ammonia as in the Brashear process. The silver and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
reducing solutions are then mixed, the water covering the mirror
poured quickly off, and the silvering solution immediately poured
on. The mirror should then be gently rocked and the silver coating
carefully watched as it forms.</p>

<p>As the operation is completed somewhat coarse black grains
of sediment will form and when these begin to be in evidence the
solution should be poured off, the mirror rinsed in running water,
the edging removed while the mirror is still rinsing and finally the
sediment very gently swabbed off with wet absorbent cotton.
Then the mirror can be set up to dry.</p>

<p>The Lundin process uses a considerably weaker silver solution
than the Brashear process, is a good deal more cleanly while in
action, and is by experienced workers said to perform best at a
materially lower temperature than the Brashear process, with the
mirror, however, always slightly warmer than the solution.
Some workers have had good results by omitting the tin chloride
solution and cleaning up the surface by the more ordinary
methods. In the Lundin process the solution is sufficiently clear
for the density acquired by the silver coating to be roughly
judged by holding an incandescent lamp under the mirror. A
good coating should show at most only the faintest possible outline
of the filament, even of a gas filled lamp.</p>

<p>Whichever process of silvering is employed, and both work
well, the final burnishing of the mirror after it is thoroughly
dry is performed in the same way, starting by tying up a very
soft ball of absorbent cotton in the softest of chamois skin.</p>

<p>This burnisher is used at first without any addition, simply to
smooth and condense the film by going over it with quick, short,
and gentle circular strokes until the entire surface has been
thoroughly cleaned and begins to show a tendency to take polish.
Then a very little of the finest optical rouge should be put on to
the same, or better another, rubber, and the mirror gone steadily
over in a similar way until it comes to a brilliant polish.</p>

<p>A good deal of care should be taken in performing this operation
to avoid the settling of dust upon the surface since scratches will
inevitably result. Great pains should also be taken not to take
any chance of breathing on the mirror or in any other way getting
the surface in the slightest degree damp. Otherwise it will not
come to a decent polish.</p>

<p>Numerous other directions for silvering will be found in the
literature, and all of them have been successfully worked at one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
time or another. The fundamental basis of the whole process is
less in the particular formula used than in the most scrupulous
care in cleaning the mirror and keeping it clean until the silvering
is completed. Also a good bit of experience is required to enable
one to perform the operation so as to obtain a uniform and dense
deposit.</p>

<small>SETTING UP AND HOUSING THE TELESCOPE</small></h2>


<p>In regard to getting a telescope into action and giving it
suitable protection, two entirely different situations present
themselves. The first relates to portable instruments or those
on temporary mounts, the second to instruments of position.
As respects the two, the former ordinarily implies general use
for observational purposes, the latter at least the possibility
of measurements of precision, and a mount usually fitted with
circles and with a driving clock. Portable telescopes may have
either alt-azimuth or equatorial mounting, while those permanently
set up are now quite universally equatorials.</p>

<p>Portable telescopes are commonly small, ranging from about
2&frac12; inches to about 5 inches in aperture. The former is the smallest
that can fairly be considered for celestial observations. If
thoroughly good and well mounted even this is capable of real
usefulness, while the five inch telescope if built and equipped
in the usual way, is quite the heaviest that can be rated as
portable, and deserves a fixed mount.</p>

<p>Setting up an alt-azimuth is the simplest possible matter.
If on a regular tripod it is merely taken out and the tripod
roughly levelled so that the axis in azimuth is approximately
vertical. Now and then one sets it deliberately askew so that
it may be possible to pass quickly between two objects at somewhat
different altitudes by swinging on the azimuth axis.</p>

<p>If one is dealing with a table tripod like Fig. 69 it should merely
be set on any level and solid support that may be at hand, the
main thing being to get it placed so that one may look through
it conveniently. This is a grave problem in the case of all
small refractors, which present their oculars in every sort of
unreachable and uncomfortable position.</p>

<p>Of course a diagonal eyepiece promises a way out of the
difficulty, but with small apertures one hesitates to lose the
light, and often something of definition, and the observer must
pretty nearly stand on his head to use the finder. With well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
adjusted circles, such are commonly found on a fixed mount,
location of objects is easy. On a portable set-up perhaps the
easiest remedy is a pair of well aligned coarse sights near the
objective end of the tube and therefore within reach when
it is pointed zenith-ward. The writer has found a low, armless,
cheap splint rocker, such as is sold for piazza use,
invaluable under these painful circumstances, and can cordially
recommend it.</p>

<p>Even better is an observing box and a flat cushion. The
box is merely a coverless affair of any smooth 7/8 inch stuff
firmly nailed or screwed together, and of three unequal dimensions,
giving three available heights on which to sit or stand.
The dimensions originally suggested by Chambers (<i>Handbook
of Astronomy</i>, II, 215) were 21 × 12 × 15 inches, but the writer
finds 18 × 10 × 14 inches a better combination.</p>

<p>The fact is that the ordinary stock telescope tripod is rather
too high for sitting, and too low for standing, comfortably.
A somewhat stubby tripod is advantageous both in point of
steadiness and in accessibility of the eyepiece when one is
observing within 30° of the zenith, where the seeing is at its
best; and a sitting position gives a much greater range of convenient
upward vision than a standing one.</p>

<p>When an equatorial mount is in use one faces the question of
adjustment in its broadest aspect. Again two totally different
situations arise in using the telescope. First is the ordinary
course of visual observation for all general purposes, in which
no precise measurements of position or dimensions are involved.</p>

<p>Here exact following is not necessary, a clock drive is convenient
rather than at all indispensable, and even circles one
may get along without at the cost of a little time. Such is the
usual situation with portable equatorials. One does not then
need to adjust them to the pole with extreme precision, but
merely well enough to insure easy following; otherwise one is
hardly better off than with an alt-azimuth.</p>

<p>In a totally different class falls the instrument with which one
undertakes regular micrometric work, or enters upon an extended
spectroscopic program or the use of precise photometric apparatus,
to say nothing of photography. In such cases a permanent
mount is almost imperative, the adjustments must be made
with all the exactitude practicable, one finds great need of
circles, and the lack of a clock drive is a serious handicap or worse.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span></p>

<p>Moreover in this latter case one usually has, and needs, some
sort of timepiece regulated to sidereal time, without which a
right ascension circle is of very little use.</p>

<p>In broad terms, then, one has to deal, first; with a telescope
on a portable mount, with or without position circles, generally
lacking both sidereal clock and driving clock, and located where
convenience dictates; second, with a telescope on a fixed mount
in a permanent location, commonly with circles and clock,
and with some sort of permanent housing.</p>

<p>Let us suppose then that one is equipped with a 5 inch instrument
like Fig. 168, having either the tripod mount, or the fixed
pillar mount shown alongside it; how shall it be set up, and, if
on the fixed mount, how sheltered?</p>

<p>In getting an equatorial into action the fundamental thing
is to place the optical axis of the telescope exactly parallel to
the polar axis of the mount and to point the latter as nearly as
possible at the celestial pole.</p>

<p>The conventional adjustments of an equatorial telescope are
as follows:</p>

<p>1. Adjust polar axis to altitude of pole.</p>

<p>2. Adjust index of declination circle.</p>

<p>3. Adjust polar axis to the meridian.</p>

<p>4. Adjust optical axis perpendicular to declination axis.</p>

<p>5. Adjust declination axis perpendicular to polar axis.</p>

<p>6. Adjust index of right ascension circle, and</p>

<p>7. Adjust optical axis of finder parallel to that of telescope.</p>

<p>Now let us take the simplest and commonest case, the adjustment
of a portable equatorial on a tripod mount, when the
instrument has a finder but neither circles nor driving clock.
Adjustments 2 and 6 automatically drop out of sight, 5 vanishes
for lack of any means to make the adjustment, and on a mount
made with high precision, like the one before us, 4 is negligible
for any purpose to which our instrument is applicable.</p>

<p>Adjustments 1, 3 and 7 are left and these should be performed
in the order 7, 1, 3, for sake of simplicity. To begin with the
finder has cross-wires in the focus of its eyepiece, and the next
step is to provide the telescope itself with similar cross-wires.</p>

<p>These can readily be made, if not provided, by cutting out a
disc of cardboard to fit snugly either the spring collar just in front
of a positive eyepiece or the eyepiece itself at the diaphragm,
if an ordinary Huygenian. Rule two diametral lines on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
circle struck for cutting the cardboard, crossing at the center,
cut out the central aperture, and then very carefully stretch
over it, guided by the diametral lines, two very fine threads or
wires made fast with wax or shellac.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_231.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 168.</span>—Clark 5-inch with Tripod and Pier.</div>
</div>

<p>Now pointing the telescope at the most distant well defined
object in view, rotate the spring collar or ocular, when, if the
crossing of the threads is central, their intersection should stay<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
on the object. If not shift a thread cautiously until the error
is corrected.</p>

<p>Keeping the intersection set on the object by clamping the tube,
one turns attention to the finder. Either the whole tube is adjustable
in its supports or the cross-wires are capable of adjustment
by screws just in front of the eyepiece. In either case finder tube
or cross-wires should be shifted until the latter bear squarely upon
the object which is in line with the cross threads of the main
telescope. Then the adjusting screws should be tightened, and
the finder is in correct alignment.</p>

<p>As to adjustments 1 and 3, in default of circles the ordinary
astronomical methods are not available, but a pretty close
approximation can be made by levelling. A good machinist’s
level is quite sensitive and reliable. The writer has one picked
out of stock at a hardware shop that is plainly sensitive to 2′
of arc, although the whole affair is but four inches long.</p>

<p>Most mounts like the one of Fig. 168 have a mark ruled on
the support of the polar axis and a latitude scale on one of the
cheek pieces. Adjustment of the polar axis to the correct
altitude is then made by placing the level on the declination
axis, or any other convenient place, bringing it to a level, and
then adjusting the tripod until the equatorial head can be revolved
without disturbing this level. Then set the polar axis to the
correct latitude and adjustment number 1 is complete for the
purpose in hand.</p>

<p>Lacking a latitude scale, it is good judgment to mark out
the latitude by the help of the level and a paper protractor. To
do this level the polar axis to the horizontal, level the telescope
tube also, and clamp it in declination to maintain it parallel.
Then fix the protractor to a bit of wood tied or screwed to the
telescope support, drop a thin thread plumb line from a pin
driven into the wood, the declination axis being still clamped,
note the protractor reading, and then raise the polar axis by
the amount of the latitude.</p>

<p>Next, with a knife blade scratch a conspicuous reference line
on the sleeve of the polar axis and its support so that when the
equatorial head is again levelled carefully you can set approximately
to the latitude at once.</p>

<p>Now comes adjustment 3, the alignment of the polar axis to
the meridian. One can get it approximately by setting the
telescope tube roughly parallel with the polar axis and, sighting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
along it, shifting the equatorial head in azimuth until the tube
points to the pole star. Then several methods of bettering the
adjustment are available.</p>

<p>At the present date Polaris is quite nearly 1° 07′ from the true
pole and describes a circle of that radius about it every 24 hours.
To get the correct place of the pole with reference to Polaris
one must have at least an approximate knowledge of the place
of that star in its little orbit, technically its hour-angle. With
a little knowledge of the stars this can be told off in the skies
almost as easily as one reckons time on a clock. Fig. 169 is, in
fact, the face of the cosmic clock, with a huge sweeping hour hand
that he who runs may read.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_233.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 169.</span>—The Cosmic Clock.</div>
</div>

<p>It is a clock in some respects curious; it has a twenty-four
hour face like some clocks and watches designed for Continental
railway time; the hour hand revolves backward, (“counter-clockwise”)
and it stands in the vertical not at noon, but at 1.20
Star Time. The two stars which mark the tip and the reverse end
of the hour hand are delta Cassiopeæ and zeta Ursæ Majoris
respectively. The first is the star that marks the bend in the
back of the great “chair,” the second (Mizar), the star which
is next to the end of the “dipper” handle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span></p>

<p>One or the other is above the horizon anywhere in the northern
hemisphere. Further, the line joining these two stars passes
almost exactly through the celestial pole, and also very nearly
through Polaris, which lies between the pole and δ Cassiopeæ.
Consequently if you want to know the hour-angle of Polaris
just glance at the clock and note where on the face δ Cassiopeæ
stands, between the vertical which is XXIV o’clock, and the
horizontal, which is VI (east) or XVIII (west) o’clock.</p>

<p>You can readily estimate its position to the nearest half
hour, and knowing that the great hour hand is vertical (δ Cassiopeæ
up) at I<sup>h</sup> 20<sup>m</sup> or (ζ Ursæ Majoris up) at XIII<sup>h</sup> 20<sup>m</sup>, you can
make a fairly close estimate of the sidereal time.</p>

<p>A little experience enables one to make excellent use of the
clock in locating celestial objects, and knowledge of the approximate
hour angle of Polaris thus observed can be turned to immediate
use in making adjustment 3. To this end slip into the
plane of the finder cross wires a circular stop of metal or paper
having a radius of approximately 1° 15′ which means a diameter
of 0.52 inch per foot of focal length.</p>

<p>Then, leaving the telescope clamped in declination as it was
after adjustment 1, turn it in azimuth across the pole until the
pole star enters the field which, if the finder inverts it will do on
the other side of the center; i.e. if it stands at IV to the naked
eye it will enter the field apparently from the XVI o’clock quarter.
When just comfortably inside the field, the axis of the telescope
is pointing substantially at the pole.</p>

<p>It is better to get Polaris in view before slipping in the stop
and if it is clearly coming in too high or too low shift the altitude
of the polar axis a trifle to correct the error. This approximate
setting can be made even with the smallest finder and on any
night worth an attempt at observation.</p>

<p>With a finder of an inch or more aperture a very quick and
quite accurate setting to the meridian can be made by the use
of Fig. 170, which is a chart of all stars of 8 mag. or brighter
within 1° 30′ of the pole. There are only three stars besides
Polaris at all conspicuous in this region, one quite close to
Polaris, the other two forming with it the triangle marked on
the chart. These two are, to the left, a star of magnitude 6.4
designated B. D. 88 112, and to the right one of magnitude 7.0,
B. D. 89 13.</p>

<p>The position of the pole for the rest of the century is marked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
on the vertical arrow and with the stars in the field of the finder
one can set the cross wires on the pole, the instrument remaining
clamped in declination, within a very few minutes of arc, quite
closely enough for any ordinary use of a portable mount. All
this could be done even better with the telescope itself, but it is
very rare to find an eyepiece with sufficient field.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_235.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 170.</span>—The Pole among the Stars.</div>
</div>

<p>At all events the effect of any error likely to be made in these
adjustments is not serious for the purpose in hand, since if one
makes an error of a minute of arc in the setting the resulting
displacement of a star in the field will even in the most unfavorable
case reach this full amount only after 6 hours following.
I.e. with any given eyepiece an error of adjustment equal to the
radius of the field will still permit following a star for an hour
or two before it drifts inconveniently wide of the center.</p>

<p>Considerable space has been devoted to these easy approximations
in setting up, since the directions commonly given require
circles and often a clock drive.</p>

<p>In some cases one has to set up a portable equatorial where
from necessity for clear sky space, Polaris is not visible. The
best plan then is to set up with great care where Polaris can be
seen, paying especial attention to the levelling. Then establish
two meridian marks on stakes at a convenient distance by turning
the telescope 180° on its declination axis and sighting through it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
in both directions. Now with a surveyor’s tape transfer the
meridian line East or West as the case may be until it can be
used where there is clear sky room.</p>

<p>Few observers near a city can get good sky room, from the
interference of houses, trees or blazing street lamps, and the
telescope must often be moved from one site to another to reach
different fields. In such case it is wise to take the very first
step toward giving the telescope a local habitation by establishing
a definite placement for the tripod.</p>

<p>To this end the three legs should be firmly linked together by
chains that will not stretch—leg directly to leg, and not to a
common junction. Then see to it that each leg has a strong
and moderately sharp metal point, and, the three points of
support being thus definitely fixed, establish the old reliable
point-slot-plane bearing as follows:</p>

<p>Lay out at the site (or sites) giving the desired clear view, a
circle scratched on the ground of such size that the three legs
of your tripod may rest approximately on its periphery. Then
lay out on the circle three points 120° apart. At each point sink
a short post 12 to 18 inches long and of any convenient diameter,
well tarred, and firmly set with the top levelled off quite closely
horizontal.</p>

<p>To the top of each bolt a square or round of brass or iron
about half an inch thick. The whole arrangement is indicated
in diagram in Fig. 171. In <i>a</i> sink a conical depression such as
is made by drilling nearly through with a 1 inch twist drill. The
angle here should be a little broader than the point on the tripod
leg. In <i>b</i> have planed a V shaped groove of equally broad angle
set with its axis pointing to the conical hole in <i>a</i>. Leave the
surface of <i>c</i> a horizontal plane.</p>

<p>Now if you set a tripod leg in <i>a</i>, another in the slot at <i>b</i> and
the third on <i>c</i>, the tripod will come in every instance to the same
level and orientation. So, if you set up your equatorial carefully
in the first place and leave the head clamped in azimuth, you
can take it in and replace it at any time still in adjustment as
exact as at the start. And if it is necessary to shift from one
location to another you can do it without delay still holding
accurate adjustment of the polar axis to the pole, and avoiding
the need of readjustment.</p>

<p>In case the instrument has a declination circle the original
set-up becomes even simpler. One has only to level the tripod,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
either with or without the equatorial head in place, and then to
set the polar axis either vertical or horizontal, levelling the tube
with it either by placing the level across the objective cell
perpendicular to the declination axis, or laying it along the tube
when horizontal.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_237.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 171.</span>—A Permanent Foothold for the Tripod.</div>
</div>

<p>Then, reading the declination circle, one can set off the co-atitude
or latitude as the case may be and, leaving the telescope
clamped in declination, lower or raise the polar axis until the tube
levels to the horizontal. When the mount does not permit wide
adjustment and has no latitude scale one is driven to laying
out a latitude templet and, placing a straight edge under the
equatorial head, or suspending a plumb line from the axis
itself, setting it mechanically to latitude.</p>

<p>Now suppose we are dealing with the same instrument, but
are planning to plant it permanently in position on its pillar
mount. It is now worth while to make the adjustments quite
exactly, and to spend some time about it. The pillar is commonly
assembled by well set bolts on a brick or concrete pier. The
preliminary steps are as already described.</p>

<p>The pillar is levelled across the top, the equatorial head, which
turns upon it in azimuth, is levelled as before, the adjustment
being made by metal wedges under the pillar or by levelling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
screws in the mount if there are any. Then the latitude is set
off by the scale, or by the declination circle, and the polar axis
turned to the approximate meridian as already described.</p>

<p>There is likely to be an outstanding error of a few minutes
of arc which should in a permanent mount be reduced as far as
practicable. At the start adjust the declination of the optical
axis of the telescope to that of the polar axis. This is done in
the manner suggested by Fig. 172.</p>

<p>Here <i>p</i> is the polar axis and <i>d</i> the declination axis. Now if
one sights, using the cross wires, through the telescope a star
near the meridian, i.e., one that is changing in declination quite
slowly, starting from the position <i>A</i> with the telescope <i>E</i>. of the
polar axes, and turns it over 180° into the position <i>B</i>, <i>W</i>. of the
polar axis, the prolongation of the line of sight, <i>b</i>, will fall below
<i>a</i>, when as here the telescope points too high in the <i>A</i> position.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_238.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 172.</span>—Aligning the Optical Axis.</div>
</div>

<p>In other words the apparent altitude of the star will change
by twice the angle between <i>A</i> and <i>p</i>. Read both altitudes on
the declination circle and split the difference with the slow motion
as precisely as the graduation of the declination circle permits.</p>

<p>The telescope will probably not now point exactly at the star,
but as the tube is swung from the <i>A</i> to the <i>B</i> position and back
the visible stars will describe arcs of circles which should be
nearly concentric with the field as defined by the stop in the
eyepiece. If not, a very slight touch on the declination slow
motion one way or the other will make them do so to a sufficient
exactness, especially if a rather high power eyepiece is used.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span></p>

<p>The optical axis of the telescope is now parallel to the polar
axis, but the latter may be slightly out of position in spite of
the preliminary adjustment. Now reverting to the polar field
of Fig. 170, swing from position <i>A</i> to <i>B</i> and back again, correcting
any remaining eccentricity of the star arcs around the pole by
cautious shifting of the polar axis, leaving the telescope clamped
in declination. The first centering is around the pole of the
instrument, the second around the celestial pole by help of a
half dozen small stars within a half degree on both sides of it,
magnitudes 9 and 10, easily visible in a 3” or 4” telescope, using
the larger field of the finder for the coarse adjustment.</p>

<p>If the divided circles read to single minutes or closer, which
they generally do not on instruments of moderate size, one can
use the readings to set the polar axis and the declination circle,
and to make the other adjustments as well.</p>

<p>In default of this help, the declination circle adjustment may
be set to read 90° when the optical axis is brought parallel to the
polar axis, and after the adjustment of the latter is complete,
the R. A. circle can be set by swinging up the telescope in the
meridian and watching for the transit of any star of known R. A.
over the central cross wire, at which moment the circle should
be clamped to the R. A. thus defined.</p>

<p>Two possible adjustments are left, the perpendicularity of the
polar and declination axes, and that of the optical axis to the
declination axis. As a rule there is no provision for either of
these, which are supposed to have been carried out by the maker.
The latter adjustment if of any moment will disclose itself as
a lateral wobble in trying to complete the adjustment of optical
axis to polar axis. It can be remedied by a liner of tinfoil or
even paper under one end of the tube’s bearing on its cradle.
Adjustment of the former is strictly a job for the maker.</p>

<p>For details of the rigorous adjustments on the larger instruments
the reader will do well to consult Loomis’ <i>Practical Astronomy</i>
page 28 and following.<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> The adjustments here considered
are those which can be effectively made without driving clock,
finely divided circles, or exact knowledge of sidereal time. The
first and last of these auxiliaries, however, properly belong with
an instrument as large as Fig. 168, on a fixed mount.</p>

<p>There are several rather elegant methods of adjusting the polar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
axis to the pole which depend on the use of special graticules in
the eyepiece, or on auxiliary devices applied to the telescope,
the general principle being automatically to provide for setting
off the distance between Polaris and the pole at the proper hour
angle. A beautifully simple one is that of Gerrish (<i>Pop. Ast.</i>
<b>29</b>, 283).</p>

<p>The simple plan here outlined will generally, however, prove
sufficient for ordinary purposes and where high precision is
necessary one has to turn to the more conventional astronomical
methods.</p>

<p>If one gives his telescope a permanent footing such as is shown
in Fig. 171 adjustment has rarely to be repeated. With a pillar
mount such as we have just now been considering the instrument
itself can be taken in doors and replaced with very slight risk
of disturbing its setting, but some provision must be made
for sheltering the mount.</p>

<p>A tarpaulin is sometimes recommended and indeed answers
well, particularly if a bag of rubber sheeting is drawn loosely
over the mount first. Better still is a box cover of copper or
galvanized iron set over the mount and closely fitting well down
over a base clamped to the pillar with a gasket to close the joint.</p>

<p>But the fact is when one is dealing with a fine instrument like
Fig. 168 of as much as 5 inches aperture, the question of a permanent
housing (call it observatory if you like) at once comes
up and will not down.</p>

<p>It is of course always more convenient to have the telescope
permanently in place and ready for action. Some observers
feel that working conditions are better with the telescope in the
open, but most prefer a shelter from the wind, even if but partial,
and the protection of a covering, however slight, in severe
weather.</p>

<p>In the last resort the question is mainly one of climate. Where
nights, otherwise of the best seeing quality, are generally windless
or with breezes so slight that the tube does not quiver a telescope
in the open, however protected between times, works perfectly
well.</p>

<p>In other regions the clearest nights are apt to be those of a
steady gentle wind producing great uniformity of conditions at the
expense of occasional vibration of the instrument and of discomfort
to the observer. Hence one finds all sorts of practice, varied
too, by the inevitable question of expense.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span></p>

<p>The simplest possible housing is to provide for the fixed
instrument a moveable cover which can be lifted or slid quite
out of the way leaving the telescope in the open air, exposed to
wind, but free from the disturbing air currents that play around
the opening of a dome. Shelters of this cheap and simple sort
have been long in use both for small and large instruments.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_241.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 173.</span>—The Simplest of Telescope Housings.</div>
</div>

<p>For example several small astrographic instruments in the
Harvard equipment are mounted as shown in Fig. 173. Here
are two fork mounts, each on a short pier, and covered in by
galvanized iron hoods made in two parts, a vertical door which
swings down, as in the camera of the foreground, and the hood
proper, hinged to the base plate and free to swing down when
the rear door is unlocked and opened. A little to the rear is a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
similar astrographic camera with the hood closed. It is all very
simple, cheap, and effective for an instrument not exceeding say
two or three feet in focal length.</p>

<p>A very similar scheme has been successfully tried on reflectors
as shown in Fig. 174. The instrument shown is a Browning
equatorial of 8&frac12; inches aperture. The cover is arranged to
open after the manner of Fig. 173 and the plan proved very
effective, preserving much greater uniformity of conditions and
hence permitting better definition
than in case of a similar
instrument peering through the
open shutter of a dome.</p>

<p>Such a contrivance gets unwieldly
in case of a refractor on
account of the more considerable
height of the pier and the length
of the tube itself. But a modification
of it may be made to
serve exceedingly well in climates
where working in the open is
advantageous. A good example
is the equatorial of the Harvard
Observatory station at Mandeville,
Jamaica, which has been
thus housed for some twenty years, as shown in Fig. 175.</p>

<p>This 11 inch refractor, used mainly on planetary detail, is
located alongside the polar telescope of 12 inches aperture and
135 feet 4 inches focal length used for making a photographic
atlas of the moon and on other special problems. The housing,
just big enough to take in the equatorial with the tube turned
low, opens on the south side and then can be rolled northward on
its track, into the position shown, where it is well clear of the
instrument, which is then ready for use.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_242.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 174.</span>—Cover for Small Reflector.</div>
</div>

<p>The climate of Jamaica, albeit extremely damp, affords remarkably
good seeing during a large part of the year, and permits
use of the telescope quite in the open without inconvenience to
the observer. The success of this and all similar housing plans
depends on the local climate more than on anything else—chiefly
on wind during the hours of good seeing. An instrument quite
uncovered suffers from gusts far more than one housed under a
dome, which is really the sum of the whole matter, save that a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
dome to a slight extent does shelter the observer in extremely
cold weather.</p>

<p>Even very large reflectors can be housed in similar fashion
if suitably mounted. For example in Fig. 176 is shown the 36
inch aperture reflector of the late Dr. Common, which was
fitted with an open fork equatorial mounting. Here the telescope
itself, with its short pier and forked polar axis, is shown in dotted
lines.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_243.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 175.</span>—Sliding Housing for 11-inch Refractor.</div>
</div>

<p>Built about it is a combined housing and observing stand
rotatable on wheels <i>T</i> about a circular track <i>R</i>. The housing
consists of low corrugated metal sides and ends, here shown
partly broken away, of dimensions just comfortably sufficient
to take in the telescope when the housing is rotated to the north
and south position, and the tube turned down nearly flat southward.
A well braced track <i>WW</i> extends back along the top of
the side housing and well to the rear. On this track rolls the
roof of the housing <i>X,X,X</i>, with a shelter door at the front end.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span></p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span></p>

<p>The members <i>U</i> constitute a framing which supports at once
the housing and the observing platform, to which access is had
by a ladder, <i>Z</i>, provided with a counterbalanced observing seat.
The instrument is put into action by clearing the door at the
end of the roof, running the roof back to the position shown in
the dotted lines, raising the tube, and then revolving the whole
housing into whatever position is necessary to permit the proper
setting of the tube.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_245.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 177.</span>—Sliding Roof Observatory.</div>
</div>

<p>This arrangement worked well but was found a bit troublesome
owing to wind and weather. With a skeleton tube and in a
favorable climate the plan would succeed admirably providing
an excellent shelter for a large telescope at very low cost.</p>

<p>Since a fork mount allows the tube to lie flat, such an instrument,
up to say 8 or 10 inches aperture can be excellently protected
by covers fitting snugly upon a base and light enough to
lift off as a whole.</p>

<p>The successful use of all these shelters however depends on
climatic conditions. They require circumstances allowing observation
in the open, as with tripod mounts, and afford no protec<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>tion
from wind or cold. Complete protection for the observer
cannot be had, except by some of the devices shown in Chapter
V, but conditions can be improved by permanent placement in
an observatory, simple or elaborate, as the builder may wish.</p>

<p>The word observatory may sound formidable, but a modest
one can be provided at less expense than a garage for the humblest
motor car. The chief difference in the economic situation is
that not even the most derided car can be picked up and carried
into the back hall for shelter, and it really ought not to be left
out in the weather.</p>

<p>The next stage of evolution is the telescope house with a
sliding roof in one or more sections—ordinarily two. In this
case the building itself is a simple square structure large enough
to accommodate the instrument with maneuvering room around
it. The side walls are carried merely high enough to give clearance
to the tube when turned nearly flat and to give head room
to the observer. The roof laps with a close joint in the middle
and each half rolls on a track supported beyond the ends of the
building by an out-rigger arranged in any convenient manner.</p>

<p>When the telescope is in use the roof sections are displaced
enough to give an ample clear space for observing, often wide
open as shown in Fig. 177, which is the house of the 16 inch Metcalf
photographic doublet at the Harvard Observatory. This
instrument is in an open fork mount like that shown in Fig. 139.</p>

<p>The sliding roof type is on the whole the simplest structure
that can be regarded as an observatory in the sense of giving
some shelter to the observer as well as the instrument. It gives
ample sky room for practical purposes even to an instrument
with a fork mount, since in most localities the seeing within
30° or so of the horizon is decidedly bad. If view nearer the
horizon is needed it can readily be secured by building up the
pier a bit.</p>

<p>Numberless modifications of the sliding roof type will suggest
themselves on a little study. One rather interesting one is used
in the housing of the 24 inch reflector of the Harvard Observatory,
11 feet 3 inches in focal length, the same of which the drive in its
original dome is shown in Fig. 139. As now arranged the lower
part of the observatory remains while the upper works are quite
similar in principle to the housing of Dr. Common’s 3 foot reflector
of Fig. 176. The cover open is shown in Fig. 178. It will be
seen that on the north side of the observatory there is an out-rigger<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
on which the top housing slides clear of the low revolving turret
which gives access to the ocular fitting used generally to carry the
plate holder, and the eyepiece for following when required.</p>

<p>The tube cannot be brought to the horizontal, but it easily
commands all the sky-space that can advantageously be used
in this situation, and the protection given the telescope when
not in use is very complete. To close the observatory the tube
is brought north and south and turned low and the sliding roof
is then run back into its fixed position. The turret is very easily
turned by hand.</p>

<p>Of course for steady work with the maximum shelter for
observer obtainable without turning to highly special types of
housing, the familiar dome is the astronomer’s main reliance.
It is in the larger sizes usually framed in steel and covered with
wood, externally sheathed in copper or steel. Sometimes in smaller
domes felt covered with rubberoid serves a good purpose, and
painted canvas is now and then used, with wooden framing.</p>

<p>But even the smallest dome of conventional construction is
heavy and rather expensive, and for home talent offers many
difficulties, especially with respect to the shutter and shutter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
opening. A hemisphere is neither easy to frame nor to cover,
and the curved sliding shutter is especially troublesome.</p>

<p>Hence for small observatories other forms of revolving roof
are desirable, and quite the easiest and cheapest contrivance is
that embodied in the “Romsey” type of observatory, devised
half a century ago by that accomplished amateur the Rev. E. L.
Berthon, vicar of Romsey. The feature of his construction is
an unsymmetrical peak in the revolving roof which permits the
ordinary shutter to be replaced by a hinged shutter like the
skylight in a roof, exposing the sky beyond the zenith when
open, and closing down over a coaming to form a water tight
joint.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span></p>

<p>Berthon’s original description of his observatory, which accommodated
a 9&frac14; inch reflector, may be found in Vol. 14 of the
<i>English Mechanic and World of Science</i> whence Fig. 179 is taken.
In this plate Fig. 1 shows the complete elevation and Fig. 2
the ground plan, each to a scale of a eighth of an inch to the foot.
In the plan, <i>A,A</i>, are the main joists, <i>P</i> the pier for the telescope,
T that for the transit, and <i>C</i> the clock. Figs. 3, 4, and 5 are of
details. In the last named <i>A</i> is a rafter, <i>b</i> the base ring, <i>c</i> the
plate, <i>d</i> one of the sash rollers carrying the roof, and <i>e</i> a lateral
guide roller holding the roof in place.</p>

<p>The structure can readily be built without the transit shelter,
and in fact now-a-days most observers find it easier to pick up
their time by wireless. The main bearing ring is cut out of
ordinary 7/8 inch board, in ten or a dozen, or more, sections
according to convenience, done in duplicate, joints lapping, and
put very firmly together with screws set up hard. Sometimes
3 layers are thus used.</p>

<p>The roof in the original “Romsey” observatory was of painted
canvas, but rubberoid or galvanized iron lined with roofing
paper answers well. The shutter can be made single or double
in width, and counterbalanced if necessary. The framing may
be of posts set in the ground as here shown, or with sills resting
on a foundation, and the walls of any construction—matched
boards of any kind, cement on wire lath, hollow tile, or concrete
blocks.</p>

<p>Chambers’ <i>Handbook of Astronomy</i> Vol. II contains quite
complete details of the “Romsey” type of observatory and is
easier to get at than the original description.</p>

<p>A very neat adaptation of the plan is shown in Fig. 180, of
which a description may be found in <i>Popular Astronomy</i> <b>28</b>, 183.
This observatory was about 9 feet in diameter, to house a 4
inch telescope, and was provided with a rough concrete foundation
on which was built a circular wall 6 feet high of hollow glazed
tile, well levelled on top. To this was secured a ring plate built
up in two layers, carrying two circles of wooden strips with a
couple of inches space between them for a runway. In this
ran 6 two-inch truck castors secured to a similar ring plate
on which was built up the frame of the “dome” arranged
as shown. Altogether a very neat and workmanlike affair,
in this case built largely by the owner but permitting construction
at very small expense almost anywhere. Another interesting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
modification of the same general plan in the same volume just
cited is shown in Fig. 181. This is also for a 4 inch refractor and
the dome proper is but 8 feet 4 inches in diameter. Like the
preceding structure the foundation is of concrete but the walls are
framed in spruce and sheathed in matched boards with a “beaver-board”
lining.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_250.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 180.</span>—A More Substantial “Romsey” Type.</div>
</div>

<p>The ring plate is three-ply, 12 sections to the layer, and its
mate on which the dome is assembled is similarly formed, though
left with the figure of a dodecagon to match the dome. The
weight is carried on four rubber tired truck rollers, and there
are lateral guide rollers on the plan of those in Fig. 179.</p>

<p>The dome itself however, is wholly of galvanized iron, in 12
gores joined with standing seams, turned, riveted, and soldered.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a><br /><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
There is a short shutter at the zenith sliding back upon a frame,
while the main shutter is removed from the outside by handles.</p>

</div>

<p>Observatories of the Romsey or allied types can be erected
at very moderate cost, varying considerably from place to place,
but running at present say from $200 to $600, and big enough to
shelter refractors of 4 to 6 inches aperture. The revolving roofs
will range from 9 to 12 feet in diameter. If reflectors are in use,
those of about double these apertures can be accommodated
since the reflector is ordinarily much the shorter for equal
aperture.</p>

<p>The sliding roof, not to say the sliding shelter, forms of housing
cost somewhat less, depending on the construction adopted.
Going to brick may double the figures quoted, but such solidity
is generally quite needless, though it is highly desirable that the
cover of a valuable instrument should be fire-proof and not easily
broken open. The stealing of objectives and accessories is not
unknown, and vandalism is a risk not to be forgotten. But to
even the matter up, housing a telescope is rather an easy thing
to accomplish, and as a matter of fact for the price of a very
modest motor car one can both buy and house an instrument
big enough to be of genuine service.</p>

<small>SEEING AND MAGNIFICATION</small></h2>


<p>Few things are more generally disappointing than one’s first
glimpse of the Heavens through a telescope. The novice is fed
up with maps of Mars as a great disc full of intricate markings,
and he generally sees a little wriggling ball of light with no more
visible detail than an egg. It is almost impossible to believe
that, at a fair opposition, Mars under the power of even the
smallest astronomical telescope really looks as big as the full moon.
Again, one looks at a double star to see not two brilliant little
discs resplendent in color, but an indeterminate flicker void of
shape and hue.</p>

<p>The fact is, that most of the time over most of the world
seeing conditions are bad, so that the telescope does not have a
fair chance, and on the whole the bigger the telescope the worse
the chance. One famous English astronomer, possessed of a
fine refractor that would be reckoned large even now-a-days,
averred that he had seen but one first class night in fifteen
years past.</p>

<p>The case is really much less bad than this implies, for even in
rather unfavorable climates many a night, at some o’clock or
other, will furnish an hour or two of pretty good seeing, while
now and then, without any apparent connection with the previous
state of the weather, a night will turn up when the pictures
in the popular astronomies come true, the stars shrink to steady
points set in clean cut rings, and no available power seems too
high.</p>

<p>One can get a good idea of the true inwardness of bad seeing
by trying to read a newspaper through an opera glass across a
hot stove. If the actual movements in the atmosphere could be
made visible they would present a strange scene of turbulence—rushing
currents taking devious courses up and around obstacles,
slowly moving whirlpools, upward slants such as gulls hug on
the quarter of a liner, great downward rushes dreaded by the
aviator, and over it all incessant ripples in every direction.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span></p>

<p>And movements of air are usually associated with changes of
temperature, as over the stove, varying the refraction and contorting
the rays that come from a distant star until the image is
quite ruined.</p>

<p>The condition for excellence of definition is that the atmosphere
through which we see shall be homogeneous, whatever its temperature,
humidity, or general trend of movement. Irregular
refraction is the thing to be feared, particularly if the variations
are sudden and frequent. Hence the common troubles near the
ground and about buildings, especially where there are roofs and
chimneys to radiate heat—even in and about an observatory dome.</p>

<p>Professor W. H. Pickering, who has had a varied experience
in climatic idiosyncrasies, gives the Northern Atlantic seaboard
the bad preëminence of having the worst observing conditions
of any region within his knowledge. The author cheerfully
concurs, yet now and then, quite often after midnight, the air
steadies and, if the other conditions are good, definition becomes
fairly respectable, sometimes even excellent.</p>

<p>Temperature and humidity as such, seem to make little
difference, and a steady breeze unless it shakes the instrument is
relatively harmless. Hence we find the most admirable definition
in situations as widely different as the Harvard station at
Mandeville, Jamaica; Flagstaff, Arizona 7000 feet up and snow
bound in winter; Italy, and Egypt. The first named is warm and
with very heavy rainfall and dew, the second dry with rather
large seasonal variation of temperature, and the others temperate
and hot respectively.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most striking evidence of the importance of uniformity
was noted by Evershed at an Indian station where good
conditions immediately followed the flooding of the rice fields
with its tendency to stabilize the temperature. Mountain
stations may be good as at Flagstaff, Mt. Hamilton, or Mt.
Wilson, or very bad as Pike’s Peak proved to be, probably owing
to local conditions.</p>

<p>In fact much of the trouble comes from nearby sources, atmospheric
waves and ripples rather than large movements, ripples
indeed often small compared with the aperture of the telescope
and sometimes in or not far outside of the tube itself.</p>

<p>Aside from these difficulties, there are still others which have
to do with the transparency of the atmosphere with respect to its
suspended matter. This does not affect the definition as such,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
but it cuts down the light to a degree that may interfere seriously
with the observation of faint stars and nebulæ. The smoke
near a city aggravates the situation, but in particular it depends
on general weather conditions which may be persistent or merely
temporary.</p>

<p>Often seeing conditions may be admirable save for this lack
of transparency in the atmosphere, so that study of the moon,
of planetary markings and even of double stars, not too faint,
may go on quite unimpeded. The actual loss of light may reach
however a magnitude or more, while the sky is quite cloudless
and without a trace of fog or noticeable haziness by day.</p>

<p>There have been a good many nights the past year (1921)
when Alcor (80 Ursæ Majoris) the tiny neighbor of Mizar, very
nearly of the 4th magnitude, has been barely or not at all visible
while the seeing otherwise was respectably good. Ordinarily
stars of 6<sup><i>m</i></sup> should be visible in a really clear night, and in a
brilliant winter sky in the temperate zones, or in the clear air of
the tropics, a good many eyes will do better than this, reaching
6<sup><i>m</i></sup>.5 or even 7<sup><i>m</i></sup>, occasionally a bit more.</p>

<p>The relation of air waves and such like irregularities to telescopic
vision was rather thoroughly investigated by Douglass
more than twenty years ago (Pop. Ast. <b>6</b>, 193) with very interesting
results. In substance, from careful observation with telescopes
from 4 inches up to 24 inches aperture, he found that the
real trouble came from what one may call ripples, disturbances
from say 4 inches wave length down to &frac34; inch or less. Long
waves are rare and relatively unimportant since their general
effect is to cause shifting of the image as a whole rather than the
destruction of detail which accompanies the shorter waves.</p>

<p>This rippling of the air is probably associated with the contact
displacements in air currents such as on a big scale become
visible in cloud forms. Clearly ripples, marked as they are by
difference of refraction, located in front of a telescope objective,
produce different focal lengths for different parts of the objective
and render a clean and stable image quite out of the question.</p>

<p>In rough terms Douglass found that waves of greater length
than half the aperture did not materially deteriorate the image,
although they did shift it as a whole, while waves of length less
than one third the aperture did serious mischief to the definition,
the greater as the ripples were shorter, and the image itself more
minute in dimension or detail.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span></p>

<p>Hence there are times when decreasing the aperture of an
objective by a stop improves the seeing considerably by increasing
the relative length of the air waves. Such is in fact found to be
the case in practical observing, especially when the seeing with a
large aperture is decidedly poor. In other words one may often
gain more by increased steadiness than he loses by lessened
“resolving power,” the result depending somewhat on the class
of observation which chances to be under way.</p>

<p>And this brings us, willy-nilly, to the somewhat abstruse
matter of resolving power, depending fundamentally upon the
theory of diffraction of light, and practically upon a good many
other things that modify the character of the diffraction pattern,
or the actual visibility of its elements.</p>

<p>When light shines through a hole or a slit the light waves are
bent at the margins and the several sets, eventually overlapping,
interfere with each other so as to produce a pattern of bright and
dark elements depending on the size and shape of the aperture,
and distributed about a central bright image of that aperture.
One gets the effect well in looking through an open umbrella at a
distant street light. The outer images of the pattern are fainter
and fainter as they get away from the central image.</p>

<p>Without burdening the reader for the moment with details to be
considered presently, the effect in telescopic vision is that a star
of real angular diameter quite negligible, perhaps 0.″001 of arc,
is represented by an image under perfect conditions like Fig. 154,
of quite perceptible diameter, surrounded by a system of rings,
faint but clear-cut, diminishing in intensity outwards. When
the seeing is bad no rings are visible and the central disc is a
mere bright blur several times larger than it ought to be.</p>

<p>The varying appearance of the star image is a very good index
of the quality of the seeing, so that, having a clear indication of
this appearance, two astronomers in different parts of the world
can gain a definite idea of each other’s relative seeing conditions.
To this end a standard scale of seeing, due largely to the efforts
of Prof. W. H. Pickering, has come into rather common use.
(H. A. <b>61</b> 29). It is as follows, based on observations with a
5 inch telescope.</p>


<p class="center">STANDARD SCALE OF SEEING</p>

<p>1. Image usually about twice the diameter of the third ring.</p>

<p>2. Image occasionally twice the diameter of the third ring.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span></p>

<p>3. Image of about the same diameter as the third ring, and
brighter at the centre.</p>

<p>4. Disc often visible, arcs (of rings) sometimes seen on brighter
stars.</p>

<p>5. Disc always visible, arcs frequently seen on brighter stars.</p>

<p>6. Disc always visible, short arcs constantly seen.</p>

<p>7. Disc sometimes sharply defined, (<i>a</i>) long arcs. (<i>b</i>) Rings
complete.</p>

<p>8. Disc always sharply defined, (<i>a</i>) long arcs. (<i>b</i>) Rings complete
all in motion.</p>

<p>9. Rings, (<i>a</i>) Inner ring stationary, (<i>b</i>) Outer rings momentarily
stationary.</p>

<p>10. Rings all stationary, (<i>a</i>) Detail between the rings sometimes
moving. (<i>b</i>) No detail between the rings.</p>

<p>The first three scale numbers indicate very bad seeing; the
next two, poor; the next two, good; and the last three, excellent.
One can get some idea of the extreme badness of scale divisions
1, 2, 3, in realizing that the third bright diffraction ring is nearly
4 times the diameter of the proper star-disc.</p>

<p>It must be noted that for a given condition of atmosphere the
seeing with a large instrument ranks lower on the scale than with
a small one, since as already explained the usual air ripples
are of dimensions that might affect a 5 inch aperture imperceptibly
and a 15 inch aperture very seriously.</p>

<p>Douglass (loc. cit.) made a careful comparison of seeing conditions
for apertures up to 24 inches and found a systematic
difference of 2 or 3 scale numbers between 4 or 6 inches aperture,
and 18 or 24 inches. With the smallest aperture the image
showed merely bodily motion due to air waves that produced
serious injury to the image in the large apertures, as might be
expected.</p>

<p>There is likewise a great difference in the average quality of
seeing as between stars near the zenith and those toward the
horizon, due again to the greater opportunity for atmospheric
disturbances in the latter case. Pickering’s experiments (loc.
cit.) show a difference of nearly 3 scale divisions between say
20° and 70° elevation. This difference, which is important, is
well shown in Fig. 182, taken from his report.</p>

<p>The three lower curves were from Cambridge observations,
the others obtained at various Jamaica stations. They clearly
show the systematic regional differences, as well as the rapid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
falling off in definition below altitude 40°, which points the importance
of making provision for comfortable observing above this
altitude.</p>

</div>

<p>The relation of the diffraction pattern as disclosed in the
moments of best seeing to its theoretical form is a very interesting
one. The diffraction through a theoretically perfect objective<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
was worked out many years ago by Sir George Airy who calculated
the exact distribution of the light in the central disc and the
surrounding rings.</p>

<p>This is shown from the centre outwards in Fig. 183, in which
the ordinates of the curve represent relative intensities while the
abscissæ represent to an arbitrary scale the distances from the
axis. It will be at once noticed that the star image, brilliant at
its centre, sinks, first rapidly and then more slowly, to a minimum
and then very gradually rises to the maximum of the first
bright ring, then as slowly sinks again to increase for the second
ring and so on.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_259.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 184.</span>—Diffraction Solid for a Star.</div>
</div>

<p>For unity brightness in the centre of the star disc the maximum
brightness of the first ring is 0.017, of the second 0.004 and the
third 0.0016. The rings are equidistant and the star disc has a
radius substantially equal to the distance between rings. One’s
vision does not follow down to zero the intensities of the rings or
of the margin of the disc, so that the latter has an apparent
diameter materially less than the diameter to the first diffraction
minimum, and the rings themselves look sharper and thinner
than the figure would show, even were the horizontal scale much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
diminished. The eye does not descend in the presence of bright
areas to its final threshold of perception.</p>

<p>One gains a somewhat vivid idea of the situation by passing
to three dimensions as in Fig. 184, the “diffraction solid” for a
star, a conception due to M. André (Mem. de l’Acad. de Lyon
<b>30</b>, 49). Here the solid represents in volume the whole light
received and the height taken at any point, the intensity at that
point.</p>

<p>A cross section at any point shows the apparent diameter of
the disc, its distance to the apex the remaining intensity, and
the volume above the section the remaining total light. Substantially
85% of the total light belongs to the central cone, for
the theoretical distribution.</p>

<p>Granting that the eye can distinguish from the background
of the sky, in presence of a bright point, only light above a certain
intensity, one readily sees why the discs of faint stars look small,
and why shade glasses are sometimes useful in wiping out the
marginal intensities of the solid. There are physiological factors
that alter profoundly the appearance of the actual star image,
despite the fact that the theoretical diffraction image for the
aperture is independent of the star’s magnitude.</p>

<p>Practically the general reduction of illumination in the fainter
stars cuts down the apparent diameters of their discs, and reduces
the number of rings visible against the background of the sky.</p>

<p>The scale of the diffraction system determines the resolving
power of the telescope. This scale is given in Airy’s original
paper (Cambr. Phil. Trans. <b>1834</b> p. 283), from which the angle α
to any maximum or minimum in the ring system is defined by</p>

<p class="center">sin α = <i>n</i>λ/<i>R</i></p>

<p>in which λ is numerically the wave length of any light considered
and <i>R</i> is the radius of the objective.</p>

<p>We therefore see that the ring system varies in dimension
inversely with the aperture of the objective and directly with the
wave length considered. Hence the bigger the objective the
smaller the disc and its surrounding ring system; and the greater
the wave length, i.e. the redder the light, the bigger the diffraction
system. Evidently there should be color in the rings but
it very seldom shows on account of the faintness of the
illumination.</p>

<p>Now the factor <span class="u"><i>n</i></span> is for the first dark ring 0.61, and for the first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
bright ring 0.81, as computed from Airy’s general theory, and
therefore if we reckon that two stars will be seen as separate
when the central disc of one falls on the first dark ring of the
other the angular distance will be</p>

<p class="center">Sin α = 0.61 λ/<i>R</i>′</p>

<p>and, taking λ at the brightest part of the spectrum i.e., about
560 μμ, in the yellow green, with α taken for sin α, we can
compute this assumed separating power for any aperture. Thus
560 μμ being very nearly 1/45,500 inch, and assuming a 5 inch
telescope, the instrument should on this basis show as double two
stars whose centres are separated by 1.″1 of arc.</p>

<p>In actual fact one can do somewhat better than this, showing
that the visible diameter of the central disc is in effect less than
the diameter indicated by the diffraction pattern, owing to the
reasons already stated. Evidently the brightness of the star is a
factor in the situation since if very bright the disc gains apparent
size, and when very faint there is sufficient difficulty in seeing
one star, let alone a pair.</p>

<p>The most thorough investigation of this matter of resolving
power was made by the Rev. W. R. Dawes many years ago
(Mem. R.A.S. <b>35</b>, 158). His study included years of observation
with telescopes of different sizes, and his final result was to
establish what has since been known as “Dawes’ Limit.”</p>

<p>To sum up Dawes’ results he established the fact that on the
average a one inch aperture would enable one to separate two
6th magnitude stars the centers of which were separated by 4.56″.
Or, to generalize from this basis, the separating power of any
telescope is for very nearly equal stars, moderately bright,
4″.56/<i>A</i> where <i>A</i> is the aperture of the telescope in inches.</p>

<p>Many years of experience have emphasized the usefulness of
this approximate rule, but that it is only approximate must be
candidly admitted. It is a limit decidedly under that just
assigned on the basis of the theory of diffraction for the central
bright wave-lengths of the spectrum. Attempts have been
made to square the two figures by assuming in the diffraction
theory a wave length of 1/55,000 inch, but this figure corresponds
to a point well up into the blue, of so low luminosity that it is of
no importance whatever in the visual use of a telescope.</p>

<p>The fact is that the visibility of two neighboring bright points<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
as distinct, depends on a complex of physical and physiological
factors, the exact relations of which have never been unravelled.
To start with we have the principles of diffraction as just
explained, which define the relation of the stellar disc to the
center of the first dark ring, but we know that under no circumstances
can one see the disc out to this limit, since vision fails
to take cognizance of the faint rim of the image. The apparent
diameter of the diffraction solid therefore corresponds to a
section taken some distance above the base, the exact point
depending on the sensitiveness of the particular observer’s eye,
the actual brilliancy of the center of the disc, and the corresponding
factors for the neighboring star.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_262.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 185.</span>—Diffraction Solid for a Disc.</div>
</div>

<p>Under favorable circumstances one would not go far amiss in
taking the visible diameter of the disc at about half that reckoned
to the center of the first dark ring. This figure in fact corresponds
to what has been shown to be within the grasp of a good
observer under favorable conditions, as we shall presently see.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if the stars are decidedly bright there is
increase of apparent diameter of the disc due to the phenomenon
known as irradiation, the spreading of light about its true image
on the retina which corresponds quite closely to the halation
produced by a bright spot on a photographic plate.</p>

<p>If, on the contrary, the stars are very faint the total amount of
light available is not sufficient to make contrast over and above
the background sufficient to disclose the two points as separate,
while if the pair is very unequal the brighter one will produce
sufficient glare to quite over-power the light from the smaller
one so that the eye misses it entirely.</p>

<p>A striking case of this is found in the companion to Sirius,
an extremely difficult object for ordinary telescopes although the
distance to the companion is about 10.6″ and its magnitude<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
is 8.4, making a superlatively easy double for the very smallest
telescope save for the overpowering effect of the light of the
large star. Another notoriously difficult object for small
telescopes is δ Cygni, a beautiful double of which the smaller
component falls unpleasantly near the first diffraction maximum
of the primary in which it is apt to be lost.</p>

<p>“Dawes’ Limit” is therefore subject to many qualifying factors.
Lewis, in the papers already referred to (Obs. <b>37</b>, 378)
did an admirable piece of investigation in going through the
double star work of about two score trained observers working
with telescopes all the way from 4 inches to 36 inches aperture.</p>

<p>From this accumulation of data several striking facts stand
out. First there is great difference between individual observers
working with telescopes of similar aperture as respects their
agreement with “Dawes’ Limit,” showing the effect of variation
in the physiological factors as well as instrumental ones.</p>

<p>Second, there is also a very large difference between the
facility of observing equal bright pairs and equal faint pairs, or
unequal pairs of any kind, again emphasizing the physiological
as well as the physical factors.</p>

<p>Finally, there is most unmistakable difference between small
and large apertures in their capacity to work up to or past the
standard of “Dawes’Limit.” The smaller telescopes are clearly
the more efficient as would be anticipated from the facts just
pointed out regarding the different effect of the ordinary and
inescapable atmospheric waves on small and large instruments.</p>

<p>The big telescopes are unquestionably as good optically
speaking as the small ones but under the ordinary working conditions,
even as good as those a double star observer seeks, the
smaller aperture by reason of less disturbance from atmospheric
factors does relatively much the better work, however good the
big instrument may be under exceptional conditions.</p>

<p>This is admirably shown by the discussion of the beautiful
work of the late Mr. Burnham, than whom probably no better
observer of doubles has been known to astronomy. His records
of discovery with telescopes of 6, 9.4, 12, 18&frac12; and 36 inches
show the relative ease of working to the theoretical limit with
instruments not seriously upset by ordinary atmospheric waves.</p>

<p>With the 6 inch aperture Burnham reached in the average 0.53
of Dawes’ limit, quite near the rough figure just suggested, and
he also fell well inside Dawes’ limit with the 9.4 inch instrument.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
With none of the others did he reach it and in fact fell short of
it by 15 to 60%. All observations being by the same notably
skilled observer and representing discoveries of doubles, so that no
aid could have been gained by familiarity, the issue becomes exceedingly
plain that size with all its advantages in resolving power
brings serious countervailing limitations due to atmosphere.</p>

<p>But a large aperture has besides its possible separating power
one advantage that can not be discounted in “light grasp,” the
power of discerning faint objects. This is the thing in which a
small telescope necessarily fails. The “light grasp” of the
telescope obviously depends chiefly on the area of the objective,
and visually only in very minor degree on the absorption of the
thicker glass in the case of a large lens.</p>

<p>According to the conventional scale of star magnitudes as now
in universal use, stars are classified in magnitudes which differ
from each other by a light ratio of 2.512. a number the logarithm
of which is 0.4, a relation suggested by Pogson some forty years
ago. A second magnitude star therefore gives only about 40%
of the light of a first magnitude star, while a third magnitude star
gives again a little less than 40% of the light of a second magnitude
star and so on.</p>

<p>But doubling the aperture of a telescope increases the available
area of the objective four times and so on, the “light grasp”
being in proportion to the square of the aperture. Thus a 10
inch objective will take in and deliver nearly 100 times as much
light as would a 1 inch aperture. If one follows Pogson’s scale
down the line he will find that this corresponds exactly to 5
stellar magnitudes, so that if a 1 inch aperture discloses, as it
readily does, a 9th magnitude star, a 10 inch aperture should
disclose a 14th magnitude star.</p>

<p>Such is substantially in fact the case, and one can therefore
readily tabulate the minimum visible for an aperture just as he
can tabulate the approximate resolving power by reference to
Dawes’ limit. Fig. 186 shows in graphic form both these relations
for ready reference, the variation of resolving power with
aperture, and that of “light grasp,” reckoned in stellar
magnitudes.</p>

<p>It is hardly necessary to state that considerable individual and
observational differences will be found in each of these cases,
in the latter amounting to not less than 0.5 to 1.0 magnitude
either way. The scale is based on the 9th magnitude star just<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
being visible with 1 inch aperture, whereas in fact under varying
conditions and with various observers the range may be from the
8th to 10th magnitude. All these things, however convenient,
must be taken merely at their true value as good working
approximations.</p>

<p>Even the diffraction theory can be taken only as an approximation
since no optical surface is absolutely perfect and in
the ordinary refracting telescope there is a necessary residual
chromatic aberration beside whatever may remain of spherical
errors.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_265.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 186.</span>—Light-grasp and Resolving Power.</div>
</div>

<p>It is a fact therefore, as has been shown by Conrady (M.N.
<b>79</b> 575) following up a distinguished investigation by Lord
Rayleigh (Sci. Papers <b>1</b> 415), that a certain small amount of
aberration can be tolerated without material effect on the
definition, which is very fortunate considering that the secondary
spectrum represents aberrations of about &frac12;,000 of the focal
length, as we have already seen.</p>

<p>The chief effect of this, as of very slight spherical aberration,
is merely to reduce the maximum intensity of the central disc
of the diffraction pattern and to produce a faint haze about it
which slightly illuminates the diffraction minima. The visible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
diameter of the disc and the relative distribution of intensity in
it is not however materially changed so that the main effect is a
little loss and scattering of light.</p>

<p>With larger aberrations these effects are more serious but
where the change in length of optical path between the ray
proceeding through the center of the objective and that from the
margin does not exceed ¼λ the injury to the definition is substantially
negligible and virtually disappears when the image is
focussed for the best definition, the loss of maximum intensity
in the star disc amounting to less than 20%.</p>

<p>Even twice this error is not a very serious matter and can be
for the most part compensated by a minute change of focus as is
very beautifully shown in a paper by Buxton(M. N. <b>81</b>, 547),
which should be consulted for detail of the variations to be
effected.</p>

<p>Conrady finds a given change <i>dp</i> in the difference in lengths of
the optical paths, related to the equivalent linear change of
focus, <i>df</i>, as follows:—</p>

<p class="center">
<i>df</i> = 8<i>dp</i>(<i>f</i>/<i>A</i>)²<br />
</p>

<p>A being the aperture and f the focal length, which indicates for
telescopes of ordinary focal ratio a tolerance of the order of
±0.01 inch before getting outside the limit λ for variation of
path.</p>

<p>For instruments of greater relative aperture the precision of
focus and in general the requirements for lessened aberration
are far more severe, proportional in fact to the square of this
aperture. Hence the severe demands on a reflector for exact
figure. An instrument working at F/5 or F/6 is extremely sensitive
to focus and demands great precision of figure to fall within
permissible values, say ¼λ to ½λ, for <i>dp</i>.</p>

<p>Further, with a given value of <i>dp</i> and the relation established
by the chromatic aberration, <i>i.e.</i>, about <i>f</i>/2000, a relation is also
determined between <i>f</i> and <i>A</i>, required to bring the aberration
within limits. The equation thus found is</p>

<p class="center">
<i>f</i> = 2.8<i>A</i>²<br />
</p>

<p>This practically amounts to the common F/15 ratio for an aperture
of approximately 5 inches. For smaller apertures a greater<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
ratio can be well used, for larger, a relatively longer focus is
indicated, the penalty being light spread into a halo over the
diffraction image and reducing faint contrasts somewhat
seriously.</p>

<p>This is one of the factors aside from atmosphere, interfering
with the full advantage of large apertures in refractors. While as
already noted small amounts of spherical aberration may be to a
certain extent focussed out, the sign of <i>df</i> must change with the
sign of the residual aberration, and a quick and certain test of the
presence of spherical aberration is a variation in the appearance
of the image inside and outside focus.</p>

<p>To emphasize the importance of exact knowledge of existing
aberrations note Fig. 187, which shows the results of Hartmann
tests on a typical group of the world’s large objectives. All
show traces of residual zones, but differing greatly in magnitude
and position as the attached scales show. The most conspicuous
aberrations are in the big Potsdam photographic refractor, the
least are in the 24 inch Lowell refractor. The former has since
been refigured by Schmidt and revised data are not yet available;
the latter received its final figure from the Lundins after the last
of the Clarks had passed on.</p>

<p>Now a glance at the curves shows that the bad zone of the
Potsdam glass was originally near the periphery, (I), hence both
involved large area and, from Conrady’s equation, seriously
enlarged <i>df</i> due to the large relative aperture at the zone. An
aberrant zone near the axis as in the stage (III) of the Potsdam
objective or in the Ottawa 15 inch objective is much less harmful
for corresponding reasons. Such differences have a direct bearing
on the use of stops, since these may do good in case of peripheral
aberration and harm when the faults are axial. Unless the
aberrations are known no general conclusions can be drawn as
to the effect of stops. Even in the Lowell telescope shown as a
whole in Fig. 188, the late Dr. Lowell found stops to be useful
in keeping down atmospheric troubles and reducing the illumination
although they could have had no effect in relation to figure.
Fig. 188 shows at the head of the tube a fitting for a big iris
diaphragm, controlled from the eye-end, the value of which was
well demonstrated by numerous observers.</p>

<p>There are, too, cases in which a small instrument, despite
intrinsic lack of resolving power, may actually do better work
than a big one. Such are met in instances where extreme con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a><br /><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>trast
of details is sought, as has been well pointed out by Nutting
(Ap. J. <b>40</b>, 33) and the situation disclosed by him finds amplification
in the extraordinary work done by Barnard with a cheap
lantern lens of 1&frac12; inch diameter and 5&frac12; inches focus (Pop. Ast.,
<b>6</b>, 452).</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 187.</span>—Hartmann Tests of Telescopes [From Hartmann’s Measures].</div>
</div>

<p>The fact is that every task must seek its own proper instrument.
And in any case the interpretation of observed results
is a matter that passes far beyond the bounds of geometrical
optics, and involves physiological factors that are dominant in
all visual problems.</p>

<p>With respect to the visibility of objects the general diffraction
theory again comes into play. For a bright line, for
example, the diffraction figure is no longer chiefly a cone like
Fig. 183, but a similar long wedge-shaped figure, with wave-like
shoulders corresponding to the diffraction rings. The visibility
of such a line depends not only on the distribution of intensity in
the theoretical wedge but on the sensitiveness of the eye and the
nature of the background and so forth, just as in the case of a
star disc.</p>

<p>If the eye is from its nature or state of adaptation keen enough
on detail but not particularly sensitive to slight differences of
intensity, the line will very likely be seen as if a section were
made of the wedge near its thin edge. In other words the
line will appear thin and sharp as the diffraction rings about a
star frequently do.</p>

<p>With an eye very sensitive to light and small differences of
contrast the appearance of absolutely the same thing may
correspond to a section through the wedge near its base, in other
words to a broad strip shading off somewhat indistinctly at the
edges, influenced again by irradiation and the character of the
background.</p>

<p>If there be much detail simultaneously visible the diffraction
patterns may be mixed up in a most intricate fashion and one
can readily see the confusion which may exist in correlating
the work of various observers on things like planetary and lunar
detail.</p>

<p>In the planetary case the total image is a complex of illuminated
areas of diffraction at the edges, which may be represented
as the diffraction solid of Fig. 185, in which the dotted lines show
what may correspond fairly to the real diameter of the planet,
the edge shading off in a way again complicated by irradiation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span></p>

<p>Fancy detail superimposed on a disc of this sort and one has a
vivid idea of the difficulty of interpreting observations.</p>

<p>It would be an exceedingly good thing if everyone who uses
his telescope had the advantage of at least a brief course in
microscopy, whereby he would gain very much in the practical
understanding of resolving power, seeing conditions, and the
interpretation of the image. The principles regarding these
matters are in fact very much the same with the two great instruments
of research.</p>

<p>Aperture, linear in the case of the telescope and the so-called
numerical in the case of the microscope, bear precisely the same
relation to resolution, the minimum resolvable detail being in
each case directly proportional to aperture in the senses here
employed.</p>

<p>Further, although the turbulence of intervening atmosphere
does not interfere with the visibility of microscopic detail, a
similar disturbing factor does enter in the form of irregular and
misplaced illumination. It is a perfectly easy matter to make
beautifully distinct detail quite vanish from a microscopic image
merely by mismanagement of the illumination, just as unsteady
atmosphere will produce substantially the same effect in the
telescopic image.</p>

<p>In the matter of magnification the two cases run quite parallel,
and magnification pushed beyond what is justified by the resolving
power of the instrument does substantially little or no good.
It neither discloses new detail nor does it bring out more sharply
detail which can be seen at all with a lower power.</p>

<p>The microscopist early learns to shun high power oculars,
both from their being less comfortable to work with, and from
their failing to add to the efficiency of the instrument except in
some rare cases with objectives of very high resolving power.
Furthermore in the interpretation of detail the lessons to be
learned from the two instruments are quite the same, although
one belongs to the infinitely little and the other to the infinitely
great.</p>

<p>Nothing is more instructive in grasping the relation between
resolving power, magnification, and the verity of detail, than the
study under the microscope of some well known objects. For
example, in Fig. 189 is shown a rough sketch of a common diatom,
<i>Navicula Lyra</i>. The tiny siliceous valve appears thus under an
objective of slightly insufficient resolving power. The general<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
form of the object is clearly perceived, as well as the central
markings, standing boldly out in the form which suggests the
specific name. No trace of any finer detail appears and no
amount of dexterity in arranging the illumination or increase of
magnifying power will show any more than here appears, the
drawing being one actually made with the camera lucida, using
an objective of numerical aperture just too small to resolve the
details of the diatoms on this particular slide.</p>

<p>Figure 189<i>a</i> shows what happens when, with the same magnifying
power, an objective of slightly greater aperture is employed.
Here the whole surface of the valve is marked with fine striations,
beautifully sharp and distinct like the lines of a steel
engraving. There is a complete change of aspect wrought by an
increase of about 20% in the resolving power. Again nothing
further can be made out by an increase of magnification, the
only effect being to make the outlines a little hazier and the view
therefore somewhat less satisfactory.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_272.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 189.</span>—The Stages of Resolution.</div>
</div>

<p>Finally in Fig. 189<i>b</i> we have again the same valve under the
same magnifying power, but here obtained from an objective
of numerical aperture 60% above that used for the main figure.
The sharp striæ now show their true character. They had their
origin in lines of very clearly distinguished dots, which are
perfectly distinct, and are due to the resolving power at last being
sufficient to show the detail which previously merely formed a
sharp linear diffraction pattern entirely incapable of being resolved
into anything else by the eye, however much it might
be magnified.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span></p>

<p>Here one has, set out in unmistakable terms, the same kind
of differences which appear in viewing celestial detail through
telescopes of various aperture. What cannot be seen at all with
a low aperture may be seen with higher ones under totally different
aspects; while in each case the apparent sharpness and
clarity of the image is somewhat extraordinary.</p>

<p>Further in Fig. 189<i>b</i> in using the resolving power of the objective
of high numerical aperture, the image may be quite wrecked
by a little carelessness in focussing, or by mismanagement of
light, so that one would hardly know that the valve had markings
other than those seen with the objectives of lower aperture, and
under these circumstances added magnification would do more
harm than good. In precisely the same way mismanagement of
the illumination in Fig. 189<i>a</i> would cause the striæ to vanish and
with <i>Navicula Lyra</i>, as with many other diatoms, the resolution
into striæ is a thing which often depends entirely on careful
lighting, and the detail flashes into distinctness or vanishes with a
suddenness which is altogether surprising. For “lighting”
read “atmosphere,” and you have just the sort of conditions
that exist in telescope vision.</p>

<p>With respect to magnifying powers what has already been
said is sufficient to indicate that on the whole the lowest power
which discloses to the eye the detail within the reach of the
resolving power of the objective is the most satisfactory.</p>

<p>Every increase above this magnifies all the optical faults of
the telescope and the atmospheric difficulties as well, beside
decreasing the diameter of the emergent pencil which enters the
eye, and thereby causing serious loss of acuity. For the eye
like any other optical instrument loses resolving power with
decrease of effective aperture, and, besides, a very narrow beam
entering it is subject to the interference of entoptic defects, such
as floating motes and the like, to a serious extent.</p>

<p>Figure 190 shows from Cobb’s experiments (Am. Jour. of Physiol.,
<b>35</b>, 335) the effect of reduction of ocular aperture upon acuity.
The curve shows very plainly that for emergent pencils below a
millimeter (1/25 inch) in diameter, visual acuity falls off almost
in direct proportion to the decreasing aperture. Below this figure
there can be only incidental gains, such as may be due to opening
up double stars and simultaneously so diminishing the general
illumination as to render the margins of the star discs a little
less conspicuous.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span></p>

<p>An emergent pencil of this diameter is not quite sufficient for
the average eye to utilize fully the available resolving power and
some excess of magnification even though it actually diminishes
visual acuity materially, may be of some service.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_274.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 190.</span>—Resolving Power of the Eye.</div>
</div>

<p>Increased acuity will of course be gained for the same magnification
in using an objective of greater diameter, to say nothing
of increased resolving power, at the cost, of course, of relatively
greater atmospheric troubles.</p>

<p>To come down to figures as to the resolving power of the eye,
often repeated experiments have shown that two points offering
strong contrast with the background can be noted as separate
by the normal eye when at an angular separation of about 3′
of arc. People, as we have seen, differ considerably in acuity
so that now and then individuals will considerably better this
figure, while others, far less keen sighted, may require a separation
of 4′ or even 5′.</p>

<p>The pair of double stars ε<sub>1</sub>, ε<sub>2</sub>, Lyræ, separated by 3′ 27″
mags. nearly 4 and 5 respectively, can be seen as separate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
by those of fairly keen vision, while Mizar and Alcor, 11′
apart, seem thrown wide to nearly every one. On the other
hand the writer has never known anybody who could separate
the two components of Asterope of the Pleiades, distant a scant
2&frac12; but of mags. 6.5 and 7.0 only, while Pleione and Atlas,
distance about 5&frac14;′, mags. 6.5 and 4, are very easy.</p>

<p>Assuming for liberality that the separation constant is in the
neighborhood of 5′ one can readily estimate the magnification
that for any telescope will take full advantage of its resolving
power. As we have already seen this resolving power is practically
4.″56/<i>A</i> for equal stars moderately bright. <a id="An_objective"></a>An objective of
4.56′ inches aperture has a resolving constant of 1″ and to
develop this should take a magnification of say 300, about 65
to the inch of aperture, requiring a focal length of ocular about
0.20 to 0.25 inch for telescopes of normal relative aperture, and
pushing the emergent pencil down to little more than 0.02 inch,—rather
further than is physiologically desirable. Except for these
extreme stunts of separation, half to two thirds this power is
preferable and conditions under which one can advantageously
go above this limit are very rare indeed.</p>

<p>A thoroughly good objective or mirror will stand quite 100
magnification to the inch without, as the microscopist would say,
“breaking down the image,” but in at least nine cases out of ten
the result will be decidedly unsatisfactory.</p>

<p>As the relative aperture of the instrument increases, other
things being equal, one is driven to oculars of shorter and shorter
focus to obtain the same magnification and soon gets into trouble.
Very few oculars below 0.20 inch in focus are made, and such
are rarely advisable, although occasionally in use down to 0.15
inch or thereabouts. The usual F/15 aperture is a figure quite
probably as much due to the undesirability of extremely short
focus oculars as to the easier corrections of the objective.</p>

<p>In the actual practice of experienced observers the indications
of theory are well borne out. Data of the habits of many observers
of double stars are of record and the accomplished veteran
editor of <i>The Observatory</i>, Mr. T. Lewis, took the trouble in one
of his admirable papers on “Double Star Astronomy” (Obs. <b>36</b>,
426) to tabulate from the original sources the practice of a large
group of experts. The general result was to show the habitual
use with telescopes of moderate size of powers around 50 per<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
inch of aperture, now and then on special occasions raised to the
neighborhood of 70 per inch.</p>

<p>But the data showed unequivocally just what has been already
indicated, that large apertures, suffering severely as they generally
do from turbulence of the air, will not ordinarily stand their
due proportion of magnification. With the refractors of 24 inches
aperture and upwards the records show that even in this double
star work, where, if anywhere, high power counts, the general
practice ran in the vicinity of 30 per inch of aperture.</p>

<p>Analyzing the data more completely in this respect Mr.
Lewis found that the best practise of the skilled observers studied
was approximately represented by the empirical equation</p>

<p><i>m</i> = 140 √<i>A</i></p>

<p>Of course the actual figures must vary with the conditions of
location and the general quality of the seeing, as well as the
work in hand. For other than double star work the tendency will
be generally toward lower powers. The details which depend
on shade perception rather than visual acuity are usually hurt
rather than helped when magnified beyond the point at which
they are fairly resolved, quite as in the case of the microscope.</p>

<p>Now and then they may be made more distinct by the judicious
use of shade glasses. Quite apart from the matter of the high
powers which can advantageously be used on a telescope, one
must for certain purposes consider the lowest powers which are
fairly applicable. This question really turns on the largest
utilizable emergent pencil from the eye piece. It used to be
commonly stated that ⅛ inch for the emergent pencil was
about a working maximum, leading to a magnification of 8 per
inch of aperture of the objective. This in view of our present
knowledge of the eye and its properties is too low an estimate of
pupillary aperture. It is a fact which has been well known for
more than a decade that in faint light, when the eye has become
adapted to its situation, the pupil opens up to two or three times
this diameter and there is no doubt that a fifth or a fourth of an
inch aperture can be well utilized, provided the eye is properly
dark-adapted. For scrutinizing faint objects, comet sweeping
and the like, one should therefore have one ocular of very wide
field and magnifying power of 4 or 5 per inch of aperture, the
main point being to secure a field as wide is practicable. One
may use for such purposes either a very wide field Huyghenian,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
or, if cross wires are to be used, a Kellner form. Fifty degrees of
field is perfectly practicable with either. As regards the rest
of the eyepiece equipment the observer may well suit his own
convenience and resources. Usually one ocular of about half
the maximum power provided will be found extremely convenient
and perhaps oftener used than either the high or low power.
Oculars of intermediate power and adapted for various purposes
will generally find their way into any telescopic equipment. And
as a last word do not expect to improve bad conditions by
magnifying. If the seeing is bad with a low power, cap the
telescope and await a better opportunity.</p>

<small>WORK FOR THE TELESCOPE</small></h2>


<p>To make at first hand the acquaintance of the celestial bodies
is, in and of itself, worth the while, as leading the mind to a
new sense of ultimate values. To tell the truth the modern man
on the whole knows the Heavens less intimately than did his
ancestors. He glances at his wrist-watch to learn the hour and
at the almanac to identify the day. The rising and setting of
the constellations, the wandering of the planets among the
stars, the seasonal shifting of the sun’s path—all these are a
sealed book to him, and the intricate mysteries that lie in the
background are quite unsuspected.</p>

<p>The telescope is the lifter of the cosmic veil, and even for
merely disclosing the spectacular is a source of far-reaching
enlightenment. But for the serious student it offers opportunities
for the genuine advancement of human knowledge
that are hard to underestimate. It is true that the great modern
observatories can gather information on a scale that staggers
the private investigator. But in this matter fortune favors
the pertinacious, and the observer who settles to a line of deliberate
investigation and patiently follows it is likely to find his
reward. There is so much within the reach of powerful instruments
only, that these are in the main turned to their own
particular spheres of usefulness.</p>

<p>For modest equipment there is still plenty of work to do.
The study of variable stars offers a vast field for exploration,
most fruitful perhaps with respect to the irregular and long-period
changes of which our own Sun offers an example. Even
in solar study there are transient phenomena of sudden eruptions
and of swift changes that escape the eye of the spectro-heliograph,
and admirable work can be done, and has been done,
with small telescopes in studying the spectra of sun spots</p>

<p>Temporary stars visible to the naked eye or to the smallest
instruments turn up every few years and their discovery has
usually fallen to the lot of the somewhat rare astronomer,
professional or amateur, who knows the field of stars as he knows<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
the alphabet. The last three important novæ fell to the amateurs—two
to the same man. Comets are to be had for the
seeking by the persistent observer with an instrument of fair
light-grasp and field; one distinguished amateur found a pair
within a few days, acting on the theory that small comets are
really common and should be looked for—most easily by one
who knows his nebulæ, it should be added.</p>

<p>And within our small planetary system lies labor sufficient
for generations. We know little even about the superficial
characters of the planets, still less about their real physical
condition. We are not even sure about the rotation periods of
Venus and Neptune. The clue to many of the mysteries requires
eternal vigilance rather than powerful equipment, for the
appearance of temporary changes may tell the whole story.
The old generation of astronomers who believed in the complete
inviolability of celestial order has been for the most part gathered
to its fathers, and we now realize that change is the law of the
universe. Within the solar system there are planetary surfaces
to be watched, asteroids to be scanned for variability or change
of it, meteor swarms to be correlated with their sources, occultations
to be minutely examined, and when one runs short of these,
our nearest neighbor the Moon offers a wild and physically
unknown country for exploration. It is suspected with good
reason of dynamic changes, to say nothing of the possible last
remnants of organic life.</p>

<p>Much of this work is well within the useful range of instruments
of three to six inches aperture. The strategy of successful
investigation is in turning attention upon those things which are
within the scope of one’s equipment, and selecting those which
give promise of yielding to a well directed attack. And to this
end efforts correlated with those of others are earnestly to be
advised. It is hard to say too much of the usefulness of directed
energies like those of the Variable Star Association and similar
bodies. They not only organize activities to an important
common end, but strengthen the morale of the individual
observer.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_1_1" id="Footnote_1_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> There is a very strong probability that Jansen was the inventor of the
compound microscope about the beginning of the seventeenth century.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_2_2" id="Footnote_2_2"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2_2"><span class="label">[2]</span></a> The statement by Galileo that he “fashioned” these first lenses can
hardly be taken literally if his very speedy construction is to be credited.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_3_3" id="Footnote_3_3"></a><a href="#FNanchor_3_3"><span class="label">[3]</span></a> Scheiner also devised a crude parallactic mount which he used in his solar
observations, probably the first European to grasp the principle of the
equatorial. It was only near the end of the century that Roemer followed his
example, and both had been anticipated by Chinese instruments with sights.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_4_4" id="Footnote_4_4"></a><a href="#FNanchor_4_4"><span class="label">[4]</span></a> He attempted to polish them on cloth, which in itself was sufficient to
guarantee failure.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_5_5" id="Footnote_5_5"></a><a href="#FNanchor_5_5"><span class="label">[5]</span></a> In Fig 13, <i>A</i> is the support of the tube and focussing screw, <i>B</i> the main
mirror, an inch in diameter, <i>CD</i> the oblique mirror, <i>E</i> the principal focus,
<i>F</i> the eye lens, and <i>G</i> the member from which the oblique mirror is carried.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_6_6" id="Footnote_6_6"></a><a href="#FNanchor_6_6"><span class="label">[6]</span></a> In fact a “four foot telescope of Mr. Newton’s invention” brought
before the Royal Society two weeks after his original paper, proved only
fair in quality, was returned somewhat improved at the next meeting,
and then was referred to Mr. Hooke to be perfected as far as might be,
after which nothing more was heard of it.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_7_7" id="Footnote_7_7"></a><a href="#FNanchor_7_7"><span class="label">[7]</span></a> Commonly, but it appears erroneously, ascribed to Lord Mansfield.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_8_8" id="Footnote_8_8"></a><a href="#FNanchor_8_8"><span class="label">[8]</span></a> This was probably due not only to unfavorable climate, but to the fact
that Herschel, with all his ingenuity, does not appear to have mastered
the casting difficulty, and was constrained to make his big speculum of Cu
75 per cent, Sn 25 per cent, a composition working rather easily and taking
beautiful, but far from permanent, polish. He never seems to have used
practically the SnCu<sub>4</sub> formula, devised empirically by Mudge (Phil. Trans.
<i>67</i>, 298), and in quite general use thereafter up to the present time.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_9_9" id="Footnote_9_9"></a><a href="#FNanchor_9_9"><span class="label">[9]</span></a> An <i>F</i>/3 mirror of 1<i>m</i> aperture by Zeiss was installed in the observatory
at Bergedorf in 1911, and a similar one by Schaer is mounted at Carre, near
Geneva.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_10_10" id="Footnote_10_10"></a><a href="#FNanchor_10_10"><span class="label">[10]</span></a> More recently his condition proves to be quite the exact equivalent of
Abbé’s <i>sine condition</i> which states that the sine of the angle made with the
optical axis by a ray entering the objective from a given axial point shall
bear a uniform ratio to the sine of the corresponding angle of emergence,
whatever the point of incidence. For parallel rays along the axis this
reduces to the requirement that the sines of the angles of emergence shall
be proportional to the respective distances of the incident rays from the axis.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_11_11" id="Footnote_11_11"></a><a href="#FNanchor_11_11"><span class="label">[11]</span></a> It is interesting to note that in computing Fig. 54<i>a</i> for the sine condition,
the other root of the quadratic gave roughly the Gaussian form of
Fig. 53.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_12_12" id="Footnote_12_12"></a><a href="#FNanchor_12_12"><span class="label">[12]</span></a> The curvature of the image is the thing which sets a limit to shortening
the relative focus, as already noted, for the astigmatic image surfaces as
we have seen, fall rapidly apart away from the axis, and both curvatures
are considerable. The tangential is the greater, corresponding roughly to
a radius notably less than ⅓ the focal length, while the radial fits a radius
of less than ⅔ this length with all ordinary glasses, given forms correcting
the ordinary aberrations. The curves are concave towards the objective
except in “anastigmats” and some objectives having bad aberrations
otherwise. Their approximate curvatures assuming a semiangular aperture
for an achromatic objective not over say 5°, have been shown to be,
to focus unity
</p>
<p>
ρ<sub>r</sub> = 1 + (1/(ν-ν′)(ν/n - ν′/n′), and ρ<sub>t</sub> = 3 + 1/(ν-ν′)(ν/n - ν′/n′)
</p>
<p>
ρ_r and ρ_t being the respective reciprocals of the radii. The surfaces are really
somewhat egg shaped rather than spherical as one departs from the axis.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_13_13" id="Footnote_13_13"></a><a href="#FNanchor_13_13"><span class="label">[13]</span></a> The doublet costs about one and a half times, and the triplet more than
twice the price of an ordinary achromatic of the same aperture.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_14_14" id="Footnote_14_14"></a><a href="#FNanchor_14_14"><span class="label">[14]</span></a> A very useful treatment of the aberrations of parabolic mirrors by Poor
is in Ap. J. 7, 114. In this is given a table of the maximum dimension of a
star disc off the axis in reflectors of various apertures. This table condenses
to the closely approximate formula
</p>

<p>
a = lld/f²<br />
</p>

<p>
where a is the aberrational diameter of the star disc, in seconds of arc, d the
distance from the axis in minutes of arc, f the denominator of the F ratio
(F/8 &amp;c.) and 11, a constant. Obviously the separating power of a telescope
(see Chap. X) being substantially 4.″56/D where D is the diameter of
objective or mirror in inches, the separating power will be impaired when
a &gt; 4.″56/D. In the photographic case the critical quantity is not 4.″56/D, but
the maximum image diameter tolerable for the purpose in hand.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_15_15" id="Footnote_15_15"></a><a href="#FNanchor_15_15"><span class="label">[15]</span></a> Instruments with a polar axis were used by Scheiner as early as 1627;
by Roemer about three quarters of a century later, and previously had
been employed, using sights rather than telescopes, by the Chinese; but
these were far from being equatorials in the modern sense.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_26_26" id="Footnote_26_26"></a><a href="#FNanchor_26_26"><span class="label">[26]</span></a> The general order of precision attained by astronomical photometers is
shown in the discovery, photographically, by Hertzsprung in 1911, that
Polaris, used as a standard magnitude for many years, is actually a variable.
Its period is very near to four days, its photographic amplitude 0.17 and its
visual amplitude about 0.1, <i>i.e.</i>, a variation of ± 5 per cent in the light was
submerged in the observational uncertainties, although once known it was
traced out in the accumulated data without great difficulty.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_27_27" id="Footnote_27_27"></a><a href="#FNanchor_27_27"><span class="label">[27]</span></a> Such apparatus is essentially appurtenant to large instruments only, say
of not less than 12″ aperture and preferably much more. The eye is
enormously more sensitive as a detector of radiant energy than any device of
human contrivance, and thus small telescopes can be well used for visual
photometry, the bigger instruments having then merely the advantage of
reaching fainter stars.</p></div>

of the field is still eccentric with respect to the small mirror, showing that
the axis of the parabola is not perpendicular to the general face of the mirror.
This can usually be remedied by the adjusting screws of the main mirror as
described, but now and then it is necessary actually to move over the small
mirror into the real optical axis. Draper (loc. cit.) gives some experiences
of this sort.</p></div>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
